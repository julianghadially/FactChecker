A struggle and profanity is then heard as the pilot asks, \"Dude, what's going on?!\"\n\n\"Horizon, we need to make an emergency landing,\" the now-out-of-breath pilot tells air traffic controllers. \"We've got a jump seater just tried to shut our engines off. We need to go direct to Portland, now.\"\n\nA little later, the pilot tells air traffic control they were able to get Emerson out of the cockpit.\n\nAsked back in July if he was trying to crash the plane, [Emerson told CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-alaska-airlines-pilot-who-tried-to-shut-off-planes-engines-mid-flight-interview/), \"No, no. I had no intention of crashing the actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids. It wasn't reality.\"\n\nThere were 83 other passengers and crew on board the plane. It was because of the full flight that Emerson ended up in the cockpit jumpseat. The handles he pulled are meant to cut off fuel in the event of a fire.\n\nEmerson previously told CBS News he was in a \"dream\" or \"dissociative state,\" and thought pulling the handles would \"wake me up.\"\n\n\"It didn't wake me up, right. It, I was in reality. I know that now,\" he said. \"It's the most consequential three seconds of my life.\"\n\nCBS News also reviewed footage of Emerson's ride in the back of a police cruiser after he was taken into custody. He stayed quiet for most of the roughly 20-minute drive, but at one point asks the officer, \"Do you believe in forgiveness?\"\n\n\"I want to be accountable. But am I gonna be forgiven for being so stupid?\" he asks.\n\nEmerson told CBS News earlier this year that at the time of the incident, he had been grieving the death of his best friend and turned first to alcohol to help before trying the psilocybin mushrooms for the first time.\n\nHe said he took mushrooms two days before the flight but, according to his attorneys, Emerson has hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, which made the effects of the psychedelic drug last for days instead of hours.\n\nEmerson has pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew and separately pleaded no contest to state charges of endangering an aircraft and 83 counts of endangering another person. For the guilty plea, he was sentenced to time served, having spent 46 days in jail, and three years of supervised release. The other charges came with a sentence of five years of probation and time served.\n\nCBS News Live\n\n[CBS News 24/7Live](https://www.cbsnews.com/live/)\n\n#### CBS News 24/7\n\n- [**Burglaries in New Jersey put luxury car owners on alert**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/07/f3acb739-5041-44b3-bc2b-e809d14396a2/thumbnail/1200x630/f2161c92f8ef65563e86c92c20437130/lilley-630am-vo-clifton-wcbsg0gt-hi-res-still-00-00-1129.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-jersey-burglaries-car-keys-stolen/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Colorado State Patrol chases off-duty Denver police officer; officer arrested**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/09/7e4c0bce-de2e-42b8-aed3-52b4601b0342/thumbnail/1200x630/6494a2c0ec226566013ca3adaba9465a/denver-police-officer-christopher-thomas-jefferson-county-sheriffs-office.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-state-patrol-chases-arrests-denver-police-officer-christopher-thomas/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Border Patrol agent indicted for sexually assaulting, robbing 4 women**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/02/25/e60f6d84-29b7-4938-9f5d-1053b511a8ea/thumbnail/1200x630/5eb382e0da7eeb5300e438442a0e8eb0/border.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/border-patrol-agent-luis-urbie-sexual-assault-robbery/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Video shows gunman firing on Stamford, Conn., police during deadly standoff**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/03/0f7699b6-5958-44c8-ac80-e74e7636df95/thumbnail/1200x630/a41485e77cc5c6345469c47aab78c26b/aiello-5p-pkg-stamford-wcbsfyxo-hi-res-still-00-00-4703.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/stamford-connecticut-standoff-hostage-negotiations-drone-video/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Man charged with DUI in wrong-way crash that killed former lawmaker**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/25/547a5f0b-1302-4354-a119-42709267f70e/thumbnail/1200x630/bce20524dfe64f4d548f8eba83ec3b63/police-car.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/charges-crash-west-virginia-tony-whitlow/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Man jailed after allegedly body slamming and knocking out lawyer at courthouse**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/10/0d8e3a11-38e3-4194-bef7-17f15a2b3824/thumbnail/1200x630/71b278b2fcbc2b74ba25b97df966a112/arapahoe-county-courthouse.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/lawyer-attacked-colorado-arapahoe-county-courthouse/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Trump walks back support for releasing video of second boat strike**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/08/48ce60e4-a044-4070-a17e-45799c3c7351/thumbnail/1200x630g2/fa602433d33e1617d45e3426aa0defb7/ap25342758333388.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-boat-strike-video-walks-back-hegseth/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Service restored at homes after water main break floods Northeast Philly streets**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/09/137ea6a7-4da7-488e-bd71-50ca78d38a23/thumbnail/1200x630/d6d35b7661a63fad23dd757cb0379327/chopper-robbins-street-water-main-break-120925-frame-56976.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/water-main-break-northeast-philadelphia-oxford-circle/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n\nView CBS News In\n\nCBS News App[Open](https://www.cbsnews.com/app/?ftag=CNM-16-10abd6g&url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joseph-emerson-alaska-airlines-pilot-flight-deck-audio-police-video/)\n\nChromeSafari[Continue](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joseph-emerson-alaska-airlines-pilot-flight-deck-audio-police-video/#app)\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\ncbsi.demdex.net\n\n# cbsi.demdex.net is blocked\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n- Try disabling your extensions.\n\nERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\n\nReload\n\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)"

ALASKA AIRLINES\n\nThe planes sport 34 lie-flat business-class suites with sliding privacy doors — the same swanky \"hard product\" that Hawaiian debuted in early 2024.\n\n![](https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2024/03/Hawaiian_Airlines_Boeing_787_ERosen_Business_Cabin_Back_Screens.jpg?width=3840)\n\nERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY\n\nWhile Alaska Airlines' flights from Seattle to Rome will only operate during the warmer months, the carrier's service to London will operate all year.\n\nReady to start your points + miles journey?\n\nWe'll guide you through everything you need to know about earning travel rewards and redeeming for unforgettable experiences.\n\n[![Beginner's guide to points and miles](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Beginner's guide to points and miles**](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/beginners/)\n\n[![The best starter travel credit cards](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\n**The best starter travel credit cards**](https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best-starter-travel-rewards-cards/)\n\n[![How to pick the right travel credit card for you](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\n**How to pick the right travel credit card for you**](https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/how-to-choose-travel-credit-card/)\n\n[![Beginner's guide to points and miles](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Beginner's guide to points and miles**](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/beginners/) [![The best starter travel credit cards](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\n**The best starter travel credit cards**](https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best-starter-travel-rewards-cards/) [![How to pick the right travel credit card for you](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\n**How to pick the right travel credit card for you**](https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/how-to-choose-travel-credit-card/)\n\nNot interested in this recommendation\n\nLondon is one of the world's top business travel markets and a major hub for the [Oneworld alliance](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/oneworld-alliance-benefits/), which Alaska Airlines is part of.\n\nAs part of its new London service, Alaska teased an \"anticipated deepening of their alliance\" with fellow Oneworld members British Airways, which calls LHR home, and American Airlines.\n\n![](https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/04/heathrow-t-3.jpeg?width=3840)\n\nLondon's Heathrow Airport (LHR). SEAN CUDAHY/THE POINTS GUY\n\n## Details: Alaska Airlines' new London service\n\nHere's how the itinerary will shake out for Alaska's new London service to and from its Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) home base — again, launching May 21, 2026.\n\n- SEA-LHR: Departs at 9:40 p.m. and arrives at 3:05 p.m. the next day (all times local)\n- LHR-SEA: Departs at 5 p.m. and arrives at 6:50 p.m. (all times local)\n\n## Booking Alaska Airlines flights with points and miles\n\nThe best way to book Alaska Airlines flights with points and miles is to use its Atmos Rewards program — the joint loyalty program it launched with Hawaiian Airlines in August.\n\nIf you don't have a stash of Atmos Rewards points in your account, note that the program is a 1:1 [transfer partner with Bilt Rewards](https://thepointsguy.com/news/alaska-airlines-atmos-rewards-bilt-partnership-future/).\n\nChecking redemptions right out of the gate on Tuesday morning, I found economy awards on Alaska's new flight starting at 30,000 Atmos Rewards points one-way. Seats in the carrier's business-class cabin, though, sat at 150,000 points on many summer 2026 dates.\n\n![](https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/12/as-screenshot-sea-lhr.png?width=3840)\n\nALASKA AIRLINES\n\nShould any business-class seats go unsold, Alaska has promised to [upgrade its top-tier Atmos Titanium](https://thepointsguy.com/news/alaska-airlines-hawaiian-announces-atmos-rewards-loyalty-program/#:~:text=at%20any%20time.-,Global%20upgrades,-Most%20U.S) status members into the front cabin —

Airlines?](https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/atmos-ascent-vs-atmos-summit/)**\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAlaska Airlines plans to launch at least a dozen new long-haul international routes from Seattle by 2030, the carrier has said repeatedly.\n\nThat includes [Tokyo](https://thepointsguy.com/news/alaska-airlines-inaugural-flight-tokyo-hawaiian/) and Seoul, South Korea, flights that kicked off earlier this year aboard Hawaiian Airlines, though those flights will be onboard Alaska-branded planes starting at some point next year.\n\n## Starlink Wi-Fi update\n\nAlaska also shared one bit of news on Tuesday about its plan to [add high-speed Starlink Wi-Fi to all its planes](https://thepointsguy.com/news/alaska-airlines-starlink-wifi-service/).\n\nThe Starlink service should start appearing on its Dreamliner fleet by next fall, the carrier announced.\n\nOnce live, Alaska plans to make its Starlink Wi-Fi service free to all Atmos Rewards members, matching connectivity already offered on most of Hawaiian's long-haul planes.\n\n**Related reading:**\n\n- [The best time to book flights for the cheapest airfare](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/best-time-to-book-a-flight/)\n-

Please view our [advertising policy](https://thepointsguy.com/advertising-policy/) and [product review methodology](https://thepointsguy.com/review-methodology/) for more information.\n\nNew\n\n### Quick summary\n\n- United MileagePlus will keep its current Premier elite status qualification requirements for 2026, with no increases or changes to thresholds.\n- Starting February 2026, all Premier members can receive upgrades on award tickets, aligning upgrade eligibility for both cash and mileage bookings.\n- PlusPoints, the upgrade currency for high-level elites, will shift to dynamic pricing in February 2027, making upgrade costs less predictable and dependent on route, demand and timing.\n- Expanded saver award availability will provide more opportunities for Premier members and select cardholders to access lower-priced premium cabin redemptions.\n\n#### What to consider\n\n- Flights on eligible partners count toward Premier status, but at least four segments must be flown with United itself.\n- Dynamic pricing for PlusPoints upgrades may result in higher costs during peak travel periods or on popular routes.\n- Limits remain on how many Premier qualifying points and PlusPoints can be earned through card spending.\n\n### What you'll miss from the article\n\n- A detailed breakdown of how dynamic PlusPoints pricing could affect upgrade strategies and tips for maximizing new upgrade opportunities.\n\nGenerated by AI with support from our editorial team.\n\nShow summary\n\nUnited Airlines started the week with some big news about its [United MileagePlus program](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/know-united-mileageplus/) for 2026 and beyond.\n\nMost important to know: The requirements to reach Premier elite status won't be changing in the new year. But the Chicago-based carrier is making some significant changes surrounding upgrades.\n\nFor starters, it will soon get a lot easier to score a spot in its premium cabins when flying on an award ticket.\n\nHowever, the airline also announced it will start dynamically pricing upgrades secured with PlusPoints, the special currency it awards to high-level elite status members. That means the number of PlusPoints you'll need for an upgraded seat will get a lot less predictable in the future.\n\nFor more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\n**Read more: [How to get upgraded on United Airlines flights](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ultimate-guide-upgrades-on-united-airlines/)**\n\n![](https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/United-Palermo-Inaugural-Boeing-767-14.jpg?width=3840)\n\nZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY\n\nThere's plenty to digest in Monday's announcements. Here's a rundown of what to know.\n\n## Premier qualification stays the same\n\nWhile United [hiked Premier qualification requirements](https://thepointsguy.com/news/united-airlines-premier-elite-pluspoints-changes-2025/) a year ago, MileagePlus members won't have any changes to digest on this front in 2026.\n\nPremier thresholds will remain exactly the same next year.\n\nHere's what it takes to qualify:\n\n![](https://thepointsguy.com/images/EmailSignUp/daily-dt.svg)\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\n\nJoin over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts\n\nEmail address\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our [Terms of Use](https://thepointsguy.com/terms-of-use/) and acknowledge the data practices in our [Privacy Policy](https://thepointsguy.com/privacy-policy/).

SEAN CUDAHY/THE POINTS GUY\n\nUntil now, United has had a fairly restrictive upgrade policy when it comes to travelers flying on award tickets. Now, the upgrade experience will be pretty consistent whether you paid for your flight with cash or miles.\n\n## Big PlusPoints changes\n\nSpeaking of PlusPoints, United announced two fairly significant changes for its special currency that unlocks perks for Premier Platinum and 1K members.\n\nTo recap:\n\n- Premier members get 40 PlusPoints upon reaching Premier Platinum status.\n- Premier 1K members get 280 PlusPoints.\n\nYou can redeem PlusPoints for upgrades into a higher cabin (including Polaris business-class) or — [new this past year](https://thepointsguy.com/news/united-airlines-pluspoints-exchange-for-perks/) — exchange them for a handful of different benefits like bonus miles, travel credits and gifting status to someone else.\n\n![United jet](https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/TLV-ZRH-Planes-19.jpg?width=3840)\n\nZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY\n\n### Credit card spending can help you earn more PlusPoints\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2026, Premier 1K members will be able to earn extra PlusPoints through spending on eligible [cobranded United credit cards](https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/united/).\n\nCurrently, United cards can help you earn PQPs toward status — but most cardholders can't earn extra PlusPoints with their spending.\n\nThis will change for 1K members in the new year, perhaps opening up new upgrade opportunities for high-level elites.\n\nNote that credit cardholders will still have [limitations](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/pqp-credit-card-spend/#:~:text=Can%20you%20earn%20United%20elite%20status%20with%20credit%20cards%3F) on how many PQPs (and by extension PlusPoints) they can earn through their card spending.\n\n### PlusPoints upgrades to go dynamic in 2027\n\nTime for the news that may raise the antennas of some Premier members.\n\nWhile it's getting easier to _earn_ PlusPoints if you're a Premier 1K member, redeeming them for upgrades is going to get a lot less predictable in the future.\n\nCurrently, United has a [neat, tidy chart](https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/mileageplus/awards/upgrades-types/pluspoints.html#using) that explains how many PlusPoints you need for an upgrade. For instance, you currently need 40 PlusPoints to move from economy to Polaris business class on a long-haul flight.\n\n![](https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/United-Palermo-Inaugural-Boeing-767-43.jpg?width=3840)\n\nZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY\n\nStarting in February 2027, though, PlusPoints upgrades will shift to dynamic pricing — which means the number of PlusPoints you'll need for a high-end seat will fluctuate based on factors like the travel date, the route, demand and how many seats are available.\n\n\"There will be upgrades that will cost less. There will be many priced around the same. And there will be those that are priced higher,\" Luc Bondar, United's chief operating officer of MileagePlus, told TPG.\n\nI'd expect to see PlusPoints upgrades cost more during the peak summer and holiday seasons and on routes where a business-class seat is a hot ticket.\n\n\"It will be very much a function of route, cabin, demand,\" Bondar said, explaining United's thinking. \"It's not a devaluation. It's just market pricing.\"\n\nUnited loyalists will ultimately have the final say there — again, this change will take effect a little over a year from now.\n\nThe move comes roughly six years after United [ditched its award chart for flight redemptions](https://thepointsguy.com/news/united-award-charts-gone/) in favor of dynamic pricing — a move we've seen across a wide swath of the airline industry.\n\n## Expanded saver award availability\n\nFinally, United also noted that it has expanded Polaris saver award availability for certain United MileagePlus members.\n\nEssentially, if you're a Premier member or a United Chase credit card holder, you'll have more chances to see cheaper award redemptions for the airline's fanciest seats — so make sure you're logged into your loyalty account when you search for award space.\n\n![business cabin](https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/United-Palermo-Inaugural-Boeing-767-28.jpg?width=3840)\n\nZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY\n\n\"We are ensuring that for our Premiers and our cardholders,\" Bondar said, \"that that's where the best access to the best award seats and best tickets resides.\"\n\nWe've seen a growing number of airlines offer cheaper mileage redemptions to certain customers, such as frequent flyers with a cobranded credit card in their wallet or those who reach elite status.\n\nThat appears to be what's happening here.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIn recent months, United executives have [teased bigger-picture changes](https://thepointsguy.com/news/united-airlines-really-big-ideas-mileageplus-program/) on the horizon for the airline's MileagePlus program. So, it's worth watching to see how the program evolves in the coming years.\n\n> View this post on Instagram\n>\n> [A post shared by The Points Guy

(Photo by Gary Hershorn/Getty Images)\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Delta pioneered premium offerings; competitors now imitate its successful strategy.\n- CEO Ed Bastian said, “United is doing their best to copy us, and I don’t blame them.”\n- United has found notable success; both airlines now dominate the premium market.\n\nDelta Air Lines has long been the top airline in the country when it comes to premium offerings. In recent years, however, Delta’s competitors have tried to close the gap a little bit and improve their own premium offerings. It sounds like Delta CEO Ed Bastian thinks that’s a good idea.\n\nOver the past several years, most of the major airlines throughout the country have made an obvious push toward offering premium options to customers, seemingly copying Delta’s longtime approach. Bastian, however, does not judge those airlines. In fact, he praised them for the move.\n\n## Delta’s Pursuit of Premium\n\nDelta has been looking to create premium offerings for customers for well over a decade, which is long before most of its other competitors.\n\nAs Edward Russell of The Points Guy points out, Delta’s push toward premium began in the years following its 2010 merger with Northwest Airlines and accelerated following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNow, premium is a key part of Delta’s brand, and that doesn’t seem like it’s changing.\n\n“We’re going to have a great year being the top end of the premium stack in travel,” Bastian said at a Morgan Stanley investor conference on Wednesday, via [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/news/american-delta-airlines-premium-demand-2026/).\n\n## Other Airlines ‘Copy’ Delta\n\nGiven Delta’s success in the premium market, other airlines have begun to try to duplicate Delta’s approach to varying degrees. Even Southwest Airlines, which has long been more of a bare-bones budget option, recently introduced premium seats with extra legroom to sell to customers.\n\nNeedless to say, Bastian has taken notice of the imitation.\n\n“Every airline in the United States has changed their strategy post-COVID,” Bastian said. “You talk about some of these other airlines, whether it’s Spirit going through a second bankruptcy and you got Frontier saying they’re going to put more premium offerings out, Southwest changing their mind, American changing — everyone has changed their mind except Delta.”\n\n## United Finds Success With Premium Options\n\nWhile most of the major airlines in the United States have followed Delta’s lead and embraced premium offerings, United Airlines has undeniably had the most success in this regard, establishing itself as Delta’s primary competitor.\n\nUnited Airlines has become so successful with this approach that CEO Scott Kirby went as far as to put United and Delta in their own category, “really winning” ahead of all of the other airlines in the country, who he said were “really losing.”\n\nKirby discussed “the [strength](https://www.mensjournal.com/entertainment/best-quotes-about-strength) of the two brand loyal airlines really winning and everyone else losing. And if I dig deeper into it and I look at every airline that’s not named United or Delta, I can find at every single one of them, a double-digit percentage of their route network that loses money,” he said [earlier this year](https://www.mensjournal.com/travel/united-ceo-does-not-hold-back-on-american-airlines).\n\n“The only way for them to get margins that are anywhere close to their WAC is to stop flying places that lose money,” he continued, referring to weighted average cost by the acronym WAC. “And that is going to ultimately happen.”\n\n## Delta CEO Has a Message For United\n\nThey say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and it sounds like Delta is flattered by United’s imitation.\n\nIn his most recent comments, Bastian sent a message to United on the airline’s apparent imitation of Delta as he made it clear that he fully understands why they would do that given Delta’s success.\n\n“United is doing their best to copy us, and I don’t blame them,” Bastian said via [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/news/american-delta-airlines-premium-demand-2026/). “I would copy Delta, too, if I was them.”\n\nClearly, the approach has worked for United, so it’s safe to assume that it will continue in the future.\n\n## About the author\n\n![](https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_1:1/MjE2NTY2OTc3OTcwMzE2NjU1/kevin-harrish.jpg?arena_f_auto)\n\n## [Kevin Harrish](https://www.mensjournal.com/author/kevin-harrish)\n\nNews Writer, Men's Journal\n\nKevin Harrish is a trending news writer for Men's Journal, focusing on travel, lifestyle, entertainment, food, and sports with over a decade of experience in media.\n\nStart the Conversation"

ULTA’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 report showed net sales of $2.9 billion (12.9% year-over-year gain), diluted per-share earnings of $5.14, 30 new stores (nearly 1,600 total across brands), and annual net sales guidance of $12.3 billion, which would mark growth of about 4.7%.\n\nIt’s no wonder [ULTA](https://www.fxempire.com/stocks/ulta) shares are up 39% this year – and they could rise more. MoneyFlows data shows how Big Money investors are betting heavily on the forward picture of the stock.\n\n## Big Money Buying Ulta Beauty\n\nInstitutional volumes reveal plenty. In the last year, ULTA has enjoyed strong investor demand, which we believe to be institutional support.\n\nEach green bar signals unusually large volumes in ULTA shares. They reflect our proprietary inflow signal, pushing the stock higher:\n\n![Source: www.moneyflows.com](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nSource: www.moneyflows.com\n\nPlenty of staples names are under accumulation right now. But there’s a powerful fundamental story happening with Ulta Beauty.\n\n## Ulta Beauty Fundamental Analysis\n\nInstitutional support and a healthy fundamental backdrop make this company worth investigating. As you can see, ULTA has had strong sales and earnings growth:\n\n- 3-year sales growth rate (+9.6%)\n\n- 3-year EPS growth rate (+13%)\n\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nAlso, EPS is estimated to ramp higher this year by +11.1%.\n\nNow it makes sense why the stock has been powering to new heights. ULTA has a track record of strong financial performance.\n\nMarrying great fundamentals with our proprietary software has found some big winning stocks over the long term.\n\nUlta Beauty has been a top-rated stock at MoneyFlows for years. That means the stock has unusual buy pressure and growing fundamentals. We have a ranking process that showcases stocks like this on a weekly basis.\n\nIt’s made the Outlier 20 report 68 times since the first rare bullish inflow signal in 2010. The blue bars below show when ULTA was a top pick…Big Money is a buyer:\n\n![Source: www.moneyflows.com](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nSource: www.moneyflows.com\n\nTracking unusual volumes reveals the power of money flows.\n\nThis is a trait that most outlier stocks exhibit…the best of the best. Big Money demand drives stocks upward.\n\n## Ulta Beauty Price Prediction\n\nThe ULTA rally isn’t new at all. Big Money buying in the shares is signaling to take notice. Given the historical gains in share price and strong fundamentals, this stock could be worth a spot in a diversified portfolio.\n\n_Disclosure: the author holds no position in ULTA at the time of publication._\n\nIf you are a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) or are a serious investor, take your investing to the next level and [follow our free weekly MoneyFlows insights](https://moneyflows.com/blog/category/big-money-insights-weekly/).\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis [article](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/earnings-guidance-and-inflows-send-ulta-beauty-skyward-1566678) was originally posted on FX Empire\n\n### More From FXEMPIRE:\n\n- [Big Money Walks the Datadog](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/big-money-walks-the-datadog-1562749)\n\n- [Flurry of Bullish Inflows Sends United Therapeutics Higher](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/flurry-of-bullish-inflows-sends-united-therapeutics-higher-1565380)\n\n- [Trials, Sales Wins Sends Jazz Pharmaceuticals Higher](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/trials-sales-wins-sends-jazz-pharmaceuticals-higher-1565850)\n\n- [See How Analog Devices Attracts Huge Institutional Inflows](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/see-how-analog-devices-attracts-huge-institutional-inflows-1565855)\n\n- [Rare Bullish Signals Send Vita Coco Shares Higher](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/rare-bullish-signals-send-vita-coco-shares-higher-1563711)\n\n- [See How Bullish Inflows Make Cisco a Big Money Favorite](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/see-how-bullish-inflows-make-cisco-a-big-money-favorite-1564381)\n\n\nView Comments\n\n[Terms](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Your Privacy Choices ![](https://s.yimg.com/dv/static/siteApp/img/privacy-choice-control.png)](https://guce.yahoo.com/state-controls?locale=en-US&state=VA)\n\n[More Info](https://finance.yahoo.com/more-info)\n\n* * *"

Haircare, however, posed a greater challenge.\n\n“This growth was partially offset by sales declines in personal styling tools,” Steelman said during the call, “which continues to navigate pressures from tariff-related price increases.”\n\nUlta isn’t the first cosmetics company to announce similar price changes this year.\n\nE.l.f.

Southwest, on its mission to\n\nfind a suitable site for the business expansion, has pinpointed Austin as a potential viable location. However, there are multiple sites in competition, and therefore, is exploring State and Local incentives along with other cost drivers to make its selection,” [council documents said](https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=464221).\n\nThursday, Austin city council will vote on whether it will allow the city to move forward with pitching the airline an incentive program that would encourage the airline to hire locally, shift money toward child care and further Southwest’s involvement in the [city of Austin’s newly created infrastructure academy](https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/austin-launches-infrastructure-academy-to-build-workforce-for-25b-in-upcoming-projects/).\n\n“A key part of what we’re doing with this potential agreement with Southwest is that … it will be a performance based incentive package where they are focused on hiring Austinites,” Austin Mayor Kirk Watson explained.\n\nAccording to council documents, the city estimates Southwest expansion in Austin would create 2,000 new jobs in the airline industry “with an average wage of ~$180,000.” Documents said the city will propose a jobs-based award of $2,750 per job hired if the person lives in the city of Austin.\n\nThe incentive program would be for five years and pay the airline up to $5 million.\n\nAccording to documents, the city would bring in nearly $20 million annually in local taxes alone from the expansion including $11,850,000 in tax revenue every year directly to the city (that includes retail sales tax, property tax and hotel occupancy tax expectations).\n\nA 10% cut of that per job award would go toward the city’s Childcare Assistance Reserve Fund.\n\n“This is a win-win-win-win kind of deal, where we’re focused with kind of a laser focus on affordability, but the way we’re focusing on affordability is making sure people have the incomes to be able to afford to stay in Austin,” Watson said.\n\n“Southwest appreciates the leadership of Mayor Kirk Watson and the Austin City Council and we look forward to working with them as we make Austin and Central Texas an even bigger part of Southwest’s future,” a spokesperson for the airline said.\n\n[Add as preferred source on Google](https://google.com/preferences/source?q=https://www.kxan.com)\n\n✕\n\n[Read Next

The government said at the time that the penalty was the largest it had ever imposed on an airline for violating consumer protection laws.\n\nMost of the money went toward compensation for travelers. But Southwest agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S. Treasury. Southwest made a $12 million payment in 2024 and a second $12 million payment earlier this year. But the Transportation Department issued an order Friday waiving the final $11 million payment, which was due Jan. 31, 2026.\n\nThe department said Southwest should get credit for significantly improving its on-time performance and investing in network operations.\n\n\"DOT believes that this approach is in the public interest as it incentivizes airlines to invest in improving their operations and resiliency, which benefits consumers directly,\" the department said in a statement. \"This credit structure allows for the benefits of the airline's investment to be realized by the public, rather than resulting in a government monetary penalty.\"\n\nThe fine stemmed from a winter storm in December 2022 that paralyzed Southwest's operations in Denver and Chicago and then snowballed when a crew-rescheduling system couldn't keep up with the chaos. Ultimately the airline canceled 17,000 flights and stranded more than 2 million travelers.\n\nThe Biden administration determined that Southwest had violated the law by failing to help customers who were [stranded in airports and hotels](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southwest-airlines-federal-investigation-holiday-debacle-stranded-millions/), leaving many of them to scramble for other flights. Many who called the airline's overwhelmed customer service center got busy signals or were stuck on hold for hours.\n\nEven before the settlement, the nation's fourth-biggest airline by revenue said the meltdown cost it more than $1.1 billion in refunds and reimbursements, extra costs and lost ticket sales over several months.\n\n# In:\n\n- [Southwest Airlines](https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/southwest-airlines/)\n\nSouthwest fined over 2022 holiday meltdown\n\n[Southwest Airlines hit with historic fine over 2022 holiday meltdown03:07](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/southwest-airlines-hit-with-historic-fine-over-2022-holiday-meltdown/)\n\n#### Southwest Airlines hit with historic fine over 2022 holiday meltdown\n\n(03:07)\n\n\n- [**Some Minnesota schools closed after winter storm blows in**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/21/42dc2ea3-9cd2-4040-8065-9cd06fa9b2fa/thumbnail/1200x630/734594dbd62d2cd01ae5def4eeb4e4c6/gettyimages-1186995494.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-schoool-closings-december-9-2025/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Chicago sees 5th snowiest start to winter since 1978**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/08/62259ad0-359f-456a-b7f7-4321d78e8a91/thumbnail/1200x630/808322bbb9f8ad4781c25af1c313ba0c/id-element-3.png#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-sees-5th-snowiest-start-to-winter-since-1978/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Judge orders NYC DOT to get rid of controversial bike lanes in Queens**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/07/04cd8c1d-8f3d-4ab4-a8e2-30239113f9aa/thumbnail/1200x630/5c4c8c794dac8aebbeb2076ade9295a3/new-guajardo-11p-pkg-as-wcbsg0ft-hi-res-still.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/astoria-queens-31st-street-bike-lanes-judge-order/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Trump announces $12 billion aid package for U.S. farmers**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/08/7eac539c-f5b8-45cd-bfdd-860247da8c3f/thumbnail/1200x630/bcc91569f60a89b89305aabdaa7f5969/gettyimages-2242627803.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-12-billion-aid-package-farmers/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**$30 million settlement approved for family of teen killed by San Diego police**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/10/5be99e81-90c1-451f-b823-a21100858f93/thumbnail/1200x630/29117dbcf97a0e7118cea304a02fe460/ap25340565921121.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/konoa-wilson-death-settlement-teen-killed-san-diego-police/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Several counties under winter weather advisories with inches of snow forecasted**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/09/84cc090d-7b20-41c9-8f6a-00857ac97b7b/thumbnail/1200x630/389be66eafeaef6f2e546bc68f454151/winter-weather-advisory.png#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pittsburgh-area-northern-counties-winter-weather-advisory/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Baltimore IG investigates claims of payment for excessive overtime**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/29/c3d3771e-20ba-4a91-acf0-9cde78e0a898/thumbnail/1200x630/3ae1818245d49d3448b5b4a8af3ee208/gettyimages-2166232440.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/inspector-general-investigation-mohs-overtime-maryland/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n- [**Douglas County proposal requires businesses report theft or face fines**\\\\\n![ ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/10/1f954118-4635-4587-8614-b6947dae42b3/thumbnail/1200x630/6a0c8ca34e5db302ab8533444f3c32c8/douglas-county-commissioners-sheriff-district-attorney.jpg#)](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-metro-area-county-ordinance-mandating-businesses-report-theft/?intcid=CNR-01-0623)\n\nView CBS News In\n\nCBS News App[Open](https://www.cbsnews.com/app/?ftag=CNM-16-10abd6g&url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southwest-airlines-2022-winter-storm-cancellations-fine-waved/)\n\nChromeSafari[Continue](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southwest-airlines-2022-winter-storm-cancellations-fine-waved/#app)\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\ncbsi.demdex.net\n\n# cbsi.demdex.net is blocked\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n- Try disabling your extensions.\n\nERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\n\nReload\n\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)"

This order does not impact customer refunds,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Biden administration [imposed the $140 million civilian penalty](https://abcnews.go.com/International/southwest-airlines-fined-record-140-million-dot-2022/story?id=105733507) on the airline in 2023 – the largest against an airline in history.\n\n[![](https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/3a569418-fd1a-4742-a0bf-084d64599afa/stabbing-SF-hospital-social-worker-gty-bh-251203_1765130933676_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Charges upgraded to murder in hospital stabbing of San Francisco social worker**\\\\\n\\\\\n- Dec 9, 9:23 PM](https://abcnews.go.com/US/social-worker-dies-injuries-suffered-san-francisco-hospital/story?id=128190045)\n\n[![](https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/e654ef3f-993c-47dc-938a-6785dc812b55/legionnaires-disease-stock-gty-jef-191021_hpMain_2_square.jpg?w=208)\\\\\n\\\\\n**14 cases of Legionnaires' disease reported in Florida**\\\\\n\\\\\n- Dec 9, 10:30 PM](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/14-cases-legionnaires-disease-reported-florida-linked-gym/story?id=128156214)\n\n[![](https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/fb2ceb24-92b8-4b3b-9968-1b5e138628ce/adam_smith_this-week-abc-bh-251207_1765121978186_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Top Armed Services Dem says Sept. 2 strike video would show GOP’s description ‘false’**\\\\\n\\\\\n- Dec 7, 11:30 AM](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-armed-services-dem-sept-2-strike-video/story?id=128185897)\n\nMost of the fine required Southwest to upgrade its technology and procedures to improve reliability and to compensate passengers for any future cancellations or significant delays caused by the airline.\n\nUnder the penalty, Southwest was also required to pay $35 million to the U.S. treasury in three installments – two installments of $12 million and one installment of $11 million. The final installment of $11 million, which was due on Jan. 31, is no longer owed to the government, according to the DOT.\n\n[**TSA announces $45 fee for travelers with no REAL ID**](https://abcnews.go.com/US/tsa-announces-45-fee-travelers-real-id/story?id=127991193)\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Southwest said the airline \"is grateful to Secretary Duffy and the DOT Team for recognizing Southwest’s significant investments in modernizing our operations. During the last two years, Southwest successfully completed an operational turnaround that directly benefits our Customers with industry leading on-time performance and percentage of completed flights without cancellations.”\n\nAs a massive winter storm battered the U.S. during the 2022 holiday season, the airline [cancelled more than 16,900 flights](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stranded-southwest-customers-details-exhaustive-efforts-home-amid/story?id=95848764), stranding more than 2 million passengers, the DOT said at the time.\n\nIn addition to the fine imposed by the DOT, the airline agreed to pay about $600 million in refunds and reimbursements to customers, the DOT said at the time it imposed the penalties.\n\n_Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify that, per the Department of Transportation, S_ _outhwest has agreed to invest the remaining fine amount as a credit toward \"system improvements.\"_\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [Airlines](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Airlines)\n\n* * *\n\n![ABC News](https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/icomoon/svg/logo.svg)\n\n* * *\n\n## Sponsored Content by Taboola\n\n[![](https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/3a569418-fd1a-4742-a0bf-084d64599afa/stabbing-SF-hospital-social-worker-gty-bh-251203_1765130933676_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Charges upgraded to murder in hospital stabbing of San Francisco social worker**\\\\\n\\\\\n- Dec 9, 9:23 PM](https://abcnews.go.com/US/social-worker-dies-injuries-suffered-san-francisco-hospital/story?id=128190045)\n\n[![](https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/e654ef3f-993c-47dc-938a-6785dc812b55/legionnaires-disease-stock-gty-jef-191021_hpMain_2_square.jpg?w=208)\\\\\n\\\\\n**14 cases of Legionnaires' disease reported in Florida**\\\\\n\\\\\n- Dec 9, 10:30 PM](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/14-cases-legionnaires-disease-reported-florida-linked-gym/story?id=128156214)\n\n[![](https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/fb2ceb24-92b8-4b3b-9968-1b5e138628ce/adam_smith_this-week-abc-bh-251207_1765121978186_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Top Armed Services Dem says Sept. 2 strike video would show GOP’s description ‘false’**\\\\\n\\\\\n- Dec 7, 11:30 AM](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-armed-services-dem-sept-2-strike-video/story?id=128185897)\n\n[![](https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/39a15f08-c295-495f-8b84-4fb13eb5baf6/national-hurricane-center-gty-jt-251205_1764976206130_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208)\\\\\n\\\\\n**How did AI do at forecasting this year's hurricane season?**\\\\\n\\\\\n- Dec 6, 7:33 AM](https://abcnews.go.com/US/ai-forecasters-predict-destructive-hurricanes/story?id=128083437)\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n![ABC News Live](https://keyframe-cdn.abcnews.com/streamprovider11.jpg?d=1765407691785)\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Department of Transportation (DOT) on Friday rescinded an $11 million penalty on Southwest Airlines imposed during the [Biden](https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/)administration.\n\nThe [order from DOT](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-12/Southwest%20Airlines%20-%20Order%202025-12-4.pdf) amends its 2023 directive, which fined Southwest $140 million, $35 million of which was due to the U.S. Treasury in three installments. Southwest made the first two payments, of $12 million each, in February 2024 and January 2025.\n\nWith the latest order, though, the airline is no longer required to pay the final $11 million installment to the Treasury. Instead, Southwest received an $11 million credit for improving its on-time performance and percentage of flights completed without disruptions, or completion factor, the order states.\n\nThe department, in initially penalizing Southwest, cited its failure to provide prompt or proper refunds, prompt flight status notifications and adequate customer assistance after winter storms [caused flight disruptions](https://thehill.com/lobbying/3793465-southwest-faces-lingering-questions-after-winter-storm-meltdown/) in December 2022 and January 2023.\n\nOf the remaining $105 million levied on Southwest, $72 million will be offset in exchange for $90 million in customer vouchers DOT ordered Southwest to provide from April 2024 to April 2027, while $33 million was credited to the company after it issued 25,000 Rapid Reward points to impacted passengers.\n\nThe guidance adds that Southwest invested more than $1 billion in operational performance and reliability improvements since the storm, including more than $112.4 million in its network operations control system.\n\nThe DOT noted that over the first nine months of this year, Southwest ranked third among the 10 largest U.S. commercial airlines in on-time performance and completion factor. In 2022, the company ranked sixth and eighth in these categories, respectively.\n\nThe [most recent data](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-10/September%202025%20ATCR.pdf) released by the department shows that as of July, 77.5 percent of Southwest flights have arrived on time this year, ranking fourth on that list.\n\nSouthwest said in a statement that it is “grateful to \\[Transportation\\] Secretary \\[Sean\\] Duffy and the DOT Team for recognizing Southwest’s significant investments in modernizing our operations.”\n\n“During the last two years, Southwest successfully completed an operational turnaround that directly benefits our Customers with industry leading on-time performance and percentage of completed flights without cancellations,” the company added.\n\nIn May, the Justice Department [dismissed a case](https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/5305192-southwest-airlines-lawsuit-trump-biden-flight-delays/) against Southwest brought by DOT under former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The DOT had alleged that Southwest advertised unrealistic flight schedules despite chronic delays in 2022.\n\n[Add as preferred source on Google](https://google.com/preferences/source?q=https://thehill.com)\n\nTags [Joe Biden](https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/) [Pete Buttigieg](https://thehill.com/people/pete-buttigieg/) [Sean Duffy](https://thehill.com/people/sean-duffy/)\n\n* * *\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

This achievement reflects a positive trajectory over the past year, with the stock experiencing a 1.58% increase in value. The banking giant, with its $81 billion market capitalization, has shown impressive momentum with a 16.49% price return over the past six months and 11.5% year-to-date. The 52-week high marks a notable recovery and growth phase for U.S. Bancorp, indicating investor confidence and the company’s strong market position. This upward movement comes as the financial sector continues to navigate economic fluctuations, with U.S. Bancorp maintaining resilience and adaptability in its operations. Trading at a P/E ratio of 11.8 and offering a 4.03% dividend yield, the bank has maintained dividend payments for an impressive 55 consecutive years. [InvestingPro](https://www.investing.com/pro/USB) analysis suggests the stock is slightly overvalued at current levels, with additional insights available in their comprehensive Pro Research Report—one of 1,400+ detailed analyses that transform complex Wall Street data into actionable intelligence.\n\nIn other recent news, U.S. Bancorp announced a regular quarterly dividend of $0.52 per common share, payable on January 15, 2026. This declaration also includes dividends for several series of the bank’s preferred stock, with the same payment date. Additionally, U.S. Bancorp has introduced the U.S. Bank Split World Mastercard, which automatically converts all purchases into three-month installment plans without interest or annual fees. In another move, the company announced a reduction in its prime lending rate to 7.00 percent, effective October 30, 2025. This change impacts various lending products across U.S. Bank branches nationwide. Furthermore, U.S. Bank has enhanced its SinglePoint treasury management platform, adding new features to improve business financial operations. Deutsche Bank recently upgraded U.S. Bancorp’s stock rating to Buy, citing improved net interest margin (NIM) outlook and better-than-expected quarterly results. These developments reflect U.S. Bancorp’s ongoing efforts to enhance its financial services and restore investor confidence.\n\n3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com.

It matters to investors because many consumer and business loan rates, mortgages and corporate borrowing costs are tied to that rate, so changes act like a ripple that affects company profits, consumer spending and overall market valuations.\n\n[![Share on X](https://static.stocktitan.net/img/icons/x-icon.png)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%24USB%20U.S.%20Bank%20Decreases%20Prime%20Lending%20Rate%20to%206.75%20Percent%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.stocktitan.net%2Fnews%2FUSB%2Fu-s-bank-decreases-prime-lending-rate-to-6-75-yyb31m40ruv4.html \"Share on X\")[![Share on Reddit](https://static.stocktitan.net/img/icons/reddit-icon.png)](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stocktitan.net%2Fnews%2FUSB%2Fu-s-bank-decreases-prime-lending-rate-to-6-75-yyb31m40ruv4.html&title=U.S.%20Bank%20Decreases%20Prime%20Lending%20Rate%20to%206.75%20Percent \"Share on Reddit\")[![Share on Facebook](https://static.stocktitan.net/img/icons/facebook-icon.png)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stocktitan.net%2Fnews%2FUSB%2Fu-s-bank-decreases-prime-lending-rate-to-6-75-yyb31m40ruv4.html&quote=%24USB%20%7C%20U.S.%20Bank%20Decreases%20Prime%20Lending%20Rate%20to%206.75%20Percent \"Share on Facebook\")[![Copy link](https://static.stocktitan.net/img/icons/link-icon.png)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/USB/u-s-bank-decreases-prime-lending-rate-to-6-75-yyb31m40ruv4.html# \"Copy link\")\n\n12/10/2025 - 05:30 PM\n\n\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nU.S. Bancorp (NYSE: [USB](https://www.stocktitan.net/overview/USB \"View USB stock overview\")) announced it has decreased its prime lending rate to 6.75 percent from 7.00 percent, effective tomorrow, December 11, 2025, at all U.S. Bank locations.\n\n**About U.S. Bancorp:**\n\nU.S. Bancorp, with approximately 70,000 employees and $695 billion in assets as of September 30, 2025, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association.

While the new U.S. Bank Split™ World Mastercard® is an ambitious step into the flexible payments market, its immediate impact on U.S. Bancorp’s short-term catalysts, mainly fee income expansion, appears moderate, given the competitive intensity and existing momentum in digital product adoption. The biggest risk remains the potential for rapidly evolving fintech entrants to disrupt traditional payments, possibly squeezing future revenue streams if U.S. Bancorp cannot maintain its edge.\n\nAmong recent company announcements, the November 3, 2025 launch of co-branded checking and credit card products with Edward Jones stands out as particularly relevant. Integrating offerings through 20,000 financial advisors positions U.S. Bancorp to further expand its reach and reinforce client loyalty, complementing the catalyst of growing payments volumes and digital services.\n\nHowever, in contrast to these new growth opportunities, investors should be aware of...\n\n[Read the full narrative on U.S. Bancorp (it's free!)](https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/banks/nyse-usb/us-bancorp/zqvf0z9c-operating-leverage-and-fee-income-will-drive-efficiency-amid-regulatory-shifts?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4222779)\n\nU.S. Bancorp's outlook anticipates $32.6 billion in revenue and $7.4 billion in earnings by 2028.

Please let us know if you have [feedback](https://www.medtechdive.com/contact/).\n\n\n### Dive Brief:\n\n- Owens & Minor [has struck](https://investors.owens-minor.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Owens--Minor-Announces-Definitive-Agreement-to-Divest-Products--Healthcare-Services-Segment-to-Platinum-Equity-for-375mm-in-Cash-and-a-Retained-Equity-Stake/default.aspx) a deal to sell a unit that provides products and services to healthcare providers, the company said Tuesday.\n- Platinum Equity is paying $375 million for the business. The Owens & Minor unit will join healthcare companies including ASP Global, LifeScan and NDC in the investment firm’s portfolio.\n- The sale, which is scheduled to close near the end of 2025, will leave Owens & Minor focused on the delivery of medical supplies directly to patients and home health agencies.\n\n### Dive Insight:\n\nOwens & Minor [first reported](https://s202.q4cdn.com/322866865/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/OMI-Q4-24-Earnings-Release.pdf) the division was up for sale in February. Talking to investors on the day of the news, Owens & Minor CEO Edward Pesicka [said the timing](https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/143498497) reflected “inbound interest” from multiple parties. The interest persuaded the company to start a broader sale process. By August, the sale was far enough along for Owens & Minor [to list the unit](https://investors.owens-minor.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Owens--Minor-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx) as a discontinued operation in its financials.\n\nThe unit provides medical supplies for infection prevention, as well as services to healthcare providers. Last year, the division [generated net revenue](https://s202.q4cdn.com/322866865/files/doc_news/Owens--Minor-Reports-Fourth-Quarter--Full-Year-Financial-Results-and-Announces-Sale-Process-Underway-for-Products--Healthcare-Service-WGV4V.pdf#) of $8 billion, compared to $2.7 billion for the patient direct business that Owens & Minor is retaining.\n\nPatient direct is potentially a faster-growing, higher-margin business than the unit that Owens & Minor is selling. Operating income for the patient direct unit was $260 million last year, compared to $53 million for the divested business.\n\nOwens & Minor [tried last year](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/owens-minor-acquisition-rotech/722223/) to strengthen its patient direct unit by acquiring home medical equipment company Rotech Healthcare Holdings for $1.36 billion. However, the companies [mutually agreed](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/owens-minor-terminate-rotech-buyout/750026/) to end the deal in June in response to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nWhile the sale to Platinum Equity could theoretically increase Owens & Minor’s capacity to strike deals, Pesicka [told investors](https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/956483373) on an earnings call in August that the company is focused on paying down debt. The company remains open to smaller bolt-on deals, the CEO said.\n\nOwens & Minor will retain a 5% stake in the divested business. If Platinum Equity sells the unit, Owens & Minor could receive a share of the proceeds.\n\n### Recommended Reading\n\n- [Owens & Minor spikes $1.36B Rotech buyout over regulatory barriers](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/owens-minor-terminate-rotech-buyout/750026/)By\n\n\n\n[Nick Paul Taylor](https://www.medtechdive.com/editors/ntaylor/)\n\n\n•\nJune 6, 2025\n\n- [![Post to LinkedIn](https://www.medtechdive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/linkedin.svg?092716141024)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A//www.medtechdive.com/news/owens-minor-375m-deal-sale-investment-firm/802304/&title=Owens%20%26%20Minor%20inks%20%24375M%20deal%20to%20sell%20unit%20to%20investment%20firm \"Post\")\n- [![Share on Facebook](https://www.medtechdive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/facebook.svg?440116200824)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//www.medtechdive.com/news/owens-minor-375m-deal-sale-investment-firm/802304/ \"Share\")\n- [![Post to X](https://www.medtechdive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/x.svg?092716141024)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Owens%20%26%20Minor%20inks%20%24375M%20deal%20to%20sell%20unit%20to%20investment%20firm%20https%3A//www.medtechdive.com/news/owens-minor-375m-deal-sale-investment-firm/802304/%20via%20@MedTechDive \"Post\")\n- ![Print this page](https://www.medtechdive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/print.svg?440116200824)\n- [![Email this page](https://www.medtechdive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/email.svg?092716141024)](mailto:?Subject=Owens%20%26%20Minor%20inks%20%24375M%20deal%20to%20sell%20unit%20to%20investment%20firm&Body=https%3A//www.medtechdive.com/news/owens-minor-375m-deal-sale-investment-firm/802304/ \"Email\")\n- [![License this article](https://www.medtechdive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/cart.svg?092716141024)purchase licensing rights](https://www.medtechdive.com/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl=https://www.medtechdive.com/news/owens-minor-375m-deal-sale-investment-firm/802304/ \"License\")\n\nFiled Under:[Medical Devices,](https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/medical-devices/)[M&A](https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/ma/)\n\n### MedTech Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\nEmail:\n\n- Select user consent:[ ]\nBy signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n[Terms of Use](https://www.informatechtarget.com/terms-of-use/) and\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.informatechtarget.com/privacy-policy/).

Bernocchi as EVP and chief operating officer (COO).\n\nBernocchi’s appointment went into effect on Dec. 5, 2025. He has served as EVP and CEO of the company’s Patient Direct segment since March 2023. His [compensation and the terms of his employment](https://www.medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com/owens-and-minor-ceo-pay-executive-compensation-median-worker/) remain unchanged despite the shift in title.\n\nThe change in title for Bernocchi comes as the company [separates its Products & Healthcare Services segment](https://www.massdevice.com/owens-minor-to-divest-phs-private-equity/). Owens & Minor opted to sell the unit to Platinum Equity, a private equity firm, for $375 million as part of a strategy aimed at optimizing its business, leveraging the company’s Patient Direct platform. Patient Direct, previously led by Bernocchi, delivers home-based care for patients with chronic conditions.\n\nBernocchi previously served as president and CEO of the company’s Byram Healthcare division, a position he took over in 2009. He originally joined Byram in 2006 as COO. Before that, he served as COO for Hemophilia Resources of America from 2000 to 2005 before its sale to Accredo Health. He also worked for Caremark/Coram from 1982 to 2000 in various roles.\n\nIn addition to Bernocchi’s appointment, Owens & Minor shared another executive change. Effective Dec. 31, 2025, Jennifer Stone, EVP and chief human resources officer (CHRO), plans to leave the company. Upon her departure, Owens & Minor intends to eliminate the CHRO position. Heath Galloway, EVP, general counsel and corporate secretary, will add oversight of the human resources function to his current responsibilities.\n\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bdd595661a8745ce044cf2fa279ab3d25f8c630ad663d21505374081518941cd?s=70&d=retro&r=g)\n\n#### About Sean Whooley\n\nSean Whooley is a senior editor who mainly produces work for MassDevice, Medical Design & Outsourcing and Drug Delivery Business News.

As the company’s press release stated, the sale “will allow the Company to focus on a simpler business model and allow for a more appropriate valuation as a leader in this segment.”\n\nGod knows long-time shareholders could use some good news. A little over four years ago, Owens & Minor stock traded at just under $50, with a market cap of $3.7 billion. Today, it’s under $250 million.\n\nI’ve never followed OMI stock, but the contrarian in me just had to take a closer look after its share price fell below $3.\n\nShould the company’s new focus be enough for penny-stock investors? Maybe. Here’s why.\n\n## **Owens & Minor’s Business Pre-COVID**\n\nThe company has quite a history in Richmond, Virginia. Founded in 1882, it has been in existence for 143 years. It went public on Jan. 29, 1988. I’ve been unable to track down details such as the IPO price. It’s not a primary concern regarding my observations about the company.\n\nLooking at income statements from S&P Global Market Intelligence for 1990 through 2024, the company posted year-over-year revenue growth in 29 of the 34 years. Its operating income was up in 23 of the 34 years, so profits were a little more volatile, but still reasonable over more than three decades.\n\nSince COVID, investors have been comparing a business’s revenue before the pandemic (2019) with its revenue after (2023 and 2024). In 2019, Owens & Minor had an operating income of $99.3 million on $9.21 billion in sales (1.1% operating margin). In 2023 and 2024, its operating margins were 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever owned grocery store stock like Kroger (KR). These are grocery-store-like margins. You have to be really well-run—Costco’s (COST)fiscal 2025 operating margin was 3.8%—to survive and thrive.\n\nStory Continues\n\nClearly, the company’s business went to rat poop between 2016 and 2019. Owens & Minor’s board dismissed former CEO Cody Phipps in November 2018 after three years of shareholder value destruction. Ed Pesicka, the former chief commercial officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific, replaced him. Pesicka remains CEO today.\n\nIn December 2018, Fitch released a scathing report downgrading the company’s long-term Issuer Default Rating from B+ to B-.\n\nIn 2018, it reported a net loss of $437 million, driven by $440 million in goodwill impairment charges. Further, due to acquisitions, its long-term debt nearly doubled that year to $1.65 billion. As of Sept. 30, 2025, its long-term debt was $1.84 billion, and its 12-month trailing interest expense was $149.8 million, more than double the level at the end of 2018.\n\n## **The 2022 Acquisition to Change Direction**\n\nIn March 2022, Owens & Minor completed a $1.7 billion acquisition of Apria, a provider of home medical equipment, including respiratory therapy and sleep apnea machines. It combined Apria with Byram Healthcare, the direct-to-patient medical supply distributor it acquired in 2017, paying $367 million, net of cash.\n\nAs a result of the Apria acquisition, the company realigned into two operating segments: Products & Healthcare Services (79% of 2022 revenue) and Patient Direct (21%). The latter’s operating income was greater than the former’s that year despite the lopsided division of sales.\n\nIn 2022, the Products & Healthcare Services segment had revenue of $7.9 billion. In 2024, it was barely higher at $8.02 billion. Meanwhile, Patient Direct revenues jumped 30% over the past two years to $2.68 billion. Patient Direct’s operating income in 2024 was $260.2 million, five times higher than Products & Healthcare Services on one-third the revenue.\n\nIt makes total sense for the company to focus exclusively on the Patient Direct business model.\n\nIt will receive $375 million in cash from Platinum Equity for the Products & Healthcare Services business, which it can use to lower its debt. In addition, it will retain a 5% interest in the business and keep approximately $150 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards.\n\nOver the nine months ended Sept. 30, Patient Direct revenues totalled $2.05 billion, 3.4% higher than a year earlier. The gross margin was 47.1%, and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) was $284.8 million, 6% higher than a year ago.\n\nOwens & Minor expects the business to generate adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 at the midpoint of its 2025 guidance.\n\n## **The Bottom Line on Owens & Minor Stock**\n\nThere are still several concerns with Owens & Minor’s business once the sale of its Products & Healthcare Services segment is completed.\n\nFor one, the debt levels will remain high. According to Fitch, EBITDA leverage will be 4.9x once the sale is completed, and will stay about 4.5x into 2026.\n\n“Successful completion of the P&HS divestiture is critical to alleviating ongoing cash flow pressures associated with this segment and improving OMI's overall financial flexibility,” Fitch stated.\n\nThe ratings agency also points out that now that it’s a pure-play Patient Direct business, it loses revenue diversification and faces heightened reimbursement risk. It also exposes itself to potential contract losses, though that risk already existed with or without the other business.\n\nFitch placed all of Owens & Minor’s ratings on RWN (Rating Watch Negative), indicating concerns about the company’s current credit rating. That could change if the Patient Direct business picks up new contracts in the months ahead.\n\nThree assumptions come into play: 1) Patient Direct’s 2025 revenues meet guidance of $2.79 billion at the midpoint, 2) 2026 revenues rise by 1.5%, to $2.83 billion, and 3) its free cash flow margin is 4%, or $11.3 million.\n\nBased on a $228 million market cap, its free cash flow yield is 5.0%. That’s decent, if not spectacular value.\n\nIf you’re risk-averse, I wouldn’t buy; put it on your watchlist instead. If Owens & Minor gets its balance sheet cleaned up--EBITDA leverage below 4.0x--it won’t be a penny stock for too much longer.\n\nIf. If. If.\n\n_On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It is a leading national distributor of medical and surgical supplies for hospitals, health systems, and other healthcare providers across the United States.\n\n\"Owens & Minor has played a vital role in supporting healthcare providers and patients across the country, and we are proud to invest in the future of P&HS,\" said [Jacob Kotzubei](https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4527083-1&h=3024804001&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.platinumequity.com%2Fpeople%2Fjacob-kotzubei%2F&a=%C2%A0Jacob+Kotzubei), Co-President of Platinum Equity. \"We are pleased to provide Owens & Minor a divestiture solution for P&HS and are grateful for the continued partnership.

We look forward to working with the team to support its continued growth and operational transformation.\"\n\nThe transaction is expected to close near the end of the year, subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions.\n\nBank of America and Fifth Third are serving as financial advisors to Platinum Equity on the P&HS acquisition. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP is serving as legal advisor, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP is serving as debt financing counsel, and Latham & Watkins LLP is serving as special regulatory counsel to Platinum Equity on the transaction.\n\nCiti and Wells Fargo are acting as financial advisors to Owens & Minor.

That’s right.\n\nMondelez International, the cookies’ parent company, announced Tuesday that the brand is launching Oreo Zero Sugar Cookies.\n\n![Zero Sugar Oreo](https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-09-180629.png?w=900)Zero Sugar Oreo\n\n“With Oreo Zero Sugar, you can indulge in the signature Oreo taste now without the sugar!​” [said](https://www.oreo.com/products/zero-sugar-chocolate-sandwich-cookies?utm_source=PR&utm_campaign=zerosugar&Size=1+Pack) the product’s description. “Oreo Zero Sugar offers the classic taste of Oreo, while allowing you to keep your health & wellness goals.”​\n\nIt’s the first time Mondelez has sold sugar-free Oreos in the U.S. They’re already sold in Europe and China, the company said.\n\nMondelez said consumers are increasingly seeking what it calls “mindful indulgence,” and the new Oreos will fill an existing gap in the market for sugar-free sandwich cookies.\n\nMondelēz International said it [spent about four years](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2025/12/09/sugar-free-oreos-cookies-2026/87685103007/) crafting the treat to ensure the cookies still offer the classic Oreo experience consumers enjoy. For sweetening, the Oreos contain maltitol, a type of sugar alcohol that’s also found in some fruits and vegetables; polydextrose, a soluble fiber; sucralose, a sweetener derived from sugar; and acesulfame potassium, a synthetic sweetener.\n\nComparing the nutrition data on Zero Sugar and regular Oreos is tricky, since the serving sizes differ. The biggest difference, though: a serving of regular Oreos contains 13 grams of added sugars, or 26% of the recommended daily amount. Zero Sugar Oreos contain none.\n\nZero Sugar Oreos and Double Stuf Zero Sugar Oreos will be available at retailers nationwide starting next month.\n\n_The Associated Press contributed to this report._\n\n[Add as preferred source on Google](https://google.com/preferences/source?q=https://www.kget.com)\n\n✕\n\n[Read Next >](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n[Live updates: 3rd day of Maya Hernandez child death trial](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n[![](https://www.kget.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/vlcsnap-2025-12-08-16h27m29s697.jpg)](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n[Read Next >](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n[Next story](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n✕\n\n✕\n\n[Read Next >](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n[Live updates: 3rd day of Maya Hernandez child death trial](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n[![](https://www.kget.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/vlcsnap-2025-12-08-16h27m29s697.jpg)](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n[Next story in 5](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\nCancel\n\n\n[Read Next >](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\n\n[Next story in 5](https://www.kget.com/news/crime-watch/live-updates-3rd-day-of-maya-hernandez-child-death-trial/?nxsparam=1)\nCancel\n\n\n[![](https://www.kget.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/kget-login-dialog-modal.webp?w=261)](https://www.kget.com/)\n\nProvided by Nexstar Media Group, Inc.\n\n## Sign in to create your free My Nexstar account featuring exclusive livestreams\n\nEnter your email and we’ll send a secure one-click link to sign in.\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\nBy clicking on any of the sign up options below, you confirm that you have read and agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.nexstar.tv/terms-of-use/), which includes a jury trial waiver and class action waiver, and that you have read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.nexstar.tv/privacy-policy/) detailing our collection, use and sharing of your personal information.\n\nBy clicking on any of the sign up options below, you confirm that you have read and agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.nexstar.tv/terms-of-use/), which includes a jury trial waiver and class action waiver, and that you have read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.nexstar.tv/privacy-policy/) detailing our collection, use and sharing of your personal information.\n\nUnlock Live NewsNo Thanks\n\n**KGET 17 News is provided by Nexstar Media Group, Inc., and uses the My Nexstar sign-in, which works across our media network.**\n\nLearn more at [nexstar.tv/privacy-policy.](https://www.nexstar.tv/privacy-policy/)\n\n**KGET 17 News is provided by Nexstar Media Group, Inc., and uses the My Nexstar sign-in, which works across our media network.**\n\n**Nexstar Media Group, Inc.** is a leading, diversified media company that produces and distributes engaging local and national news, sports, and entertainment content across its television and digital platforms.

Please let us know if you have [feedback](https://www.fooddive.com/contact/).\n\n\nOreo is launching a sugar-free option as the world’s best-selling cookie brand aims to fill a void in snacking and better position itself among health-conscious consumers.\n\nThe cookie’s owner, Mondelēz International, worked for about four years to develop the Oreo Zero Sugar, which will be available in January 2026. The zero-sugar cookie has a “100% authentic OREO experience” that replicates the original, according to Michelle Deignan, vice president of marketing for the Oreo brand at Mondelēz.\n\n“Until now, the sandwich cookie category has been relatively absent from the sugar-free snack segment,” she said in an email to Food Dive. “This gap presented an incredible opportunity for the OREO brand to step in and redefine what indulgence can look like.”\n\nEven as people lower their sugar consumption, many still want to indulge in their favorite products. Those consumers often are turned off by the unavailability of sugar-free options or the taste profile of those on the market. Sugar is “the number one barrier” stopping some consumers from purchasing cookies, Deignan observed.\n\nMore than six in 10 Americans are concerned about how much sugar they consume, [according to the International Food Information Council](https://ific.org/wp-content/uploads/IFIC-FH-Survey-Food-Nutrition-October-2025.pdf). “Low in sugar” has also ranked among the top three qualities consumers use to define healthy foods for the past three years.\n\n![A Oreo cookie with zero sugar](https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/fz9HEHoJCzIhepokSKSgvB3OmQiFVY14ybyKhLHjsaA/g:nowe:0:697/c:2797:1580/rs:fit:0:860/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9PUkVPX1plcm9fU3VnYXJfQ29va2llX1Bob3RvX0NyZWRpdF9fT1JFT19Nb25kZWxlei1mb3Rvci0yMDI1MTIwODEzMTI1OC5qcGc=.webp)\n\n[Optional Caption](https://ific.org/wp-content/uploads/IFIC-FH-Survey-Food-Nutrition-October-2025.pdf)\n\n[Courtesy of Mondelēz International](https://ific.org/wp-content/uploads/IFIC-FH-Survey-Food-Nutrition-October-2025.pdf)\n\nOreo was launched in 1912 and today is the most popular cookie sold in retail locations around the world. It’s a significant part of Mondelēz’s $36 billion in annual revenue, with Oreo sales topping $4 billion. An estimated 60 billion Oreo cookies are sold each year, a third of them in the U.S. alone, [according to Mondelēz](https://ir.mondelezinternational.com/news-releases/news-release-details/coca-colar-and-oreor-brands-become-besties-launch-limited).\n\nMondelēz is launching Oreo Zero Sugar in Original and Double Stuf.\n\nDeignan said the sugar-free line offers “a valuable opportunity to truly disrupt the \\[sandwich cookie\\] category” while providing more options for consumers who prioritize lower-sugar options. It also allows the brand “to reach entirely new audiences” who may not have considered the cookie category as a suitable option for their dietary needs.\n\nSugar-free Oreo versions have previously been launched in China and Europe. Deignan said Mondelēz incorporated insight from these markets to “refine its approach” with the U.S. version.\n\nKeep up with the story.

Changes included adjusting the sweetness profile and rolling out a stand-up pouch for the cookies.\n\nThe U.S. version of the cookie is sweetened with a blend of maltitol, polydextrose, sucralose and acesulfame potassium. The blend helps replicate the sweetness and texture of sugar while “minimizing impact on the iconic taste and texture of the OREO cookie,” Deignan noted.\n\nThe company has leveraged Oreo’s popularity to extend the brand into other cookie varieties and food categories.\n\nMondelēz rolled out its first gluten-free Oreos in 2021. It has introduced dozens of permanent and limited-time Oreo flavors, including Birthday Cake and Cotton Candy, and collaborated with singers such as [Lady Gaga and Post Malone](https://www.fooddive.com/news/leftovers-mondelez-post-malone-oreo-cookie-flavor-velveeta-to-go-kraft-heinz-packet/738213/) on special versions of the snack.\n\nEarlier this year, [Oreo partnered with Hershey’s Reese’s brand](https://www.fooddive.com/news/reeses-oreo-Hershey-mondelez-partner-new-cups-and-cookies-following-consumer-demand/756288/) to launch cookies and cups that combined the two multi-billion-dollar offerings. Mondelēz has also moved Oreo beyond cookies into mini cakes known as Oreo Cakesters and licensed the brand for use in cereal, ice cream and other food offerings.\n\n“The U.S. audience has incredibly high expectations for the OREO brand, and we wouldn’t settle for launching a product that didn’t fully deliver on the playful, delicious experience people associate with the brand,” Deignan said.\n\n### Recommended Reading\n\n- [Oreo-maker Mondelēz wants a slice of the $97B cakes and pastries space](https://www.fooddive.com/news/mondelez-aiming-to-take-big-roll-in-97b-cakes-and-pastries-space/740517/)By\n\n\n\n[Christopher Doering](https://www.fooddive.com/editors/cdoering/)\n\n\n•\nMarch 10, 2025\n- [Inside Perfect Snacks’ ambitious goal to become Mondelēz’s next $1B brand](https://www.fooddive.com/news/perfect-snacks-ambitious-goal-to-become-mondelez-internationals-next-1b/804403/)By\n\n\n\n[Christopher Doering](https://www.fooddive.com/editors/cdoering/)\n\n\n•\nNov. 6, 2025\n\n- [![Post to LinkedIn](https://www.fooddive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/linkedin.svg?092716141024)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A//www.fooddive.com/news/mondelez-launches-sugar-free-oreos-snacking/806067/&title=Mondel%C4%93z%20launches%20sugar-free%20Oreos%20to%20%E2%80%98disrupt%E2%80%99%20better-for-you%20snacking \"Post\")\n- [![Share on Facebook](https://www.fooddive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/facebook.svg?440116200824)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//www.fooddive.com/news/mondelez-launches-sugar-free-oreos-snacking/806067/ \"Share\")\n- [![Post to X](https://www.fooddive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/x.svg?092716141024)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mondel%C4%93z%20launches%20sugar-free%20Oreos%20to%20%E2%80%98disrupt%E2%80%99%20better-for-you%20snacking%20https%3A//www.fooddive.com/news/mondelez-launches-sugar-free-oreos-snacking/806067/%20via%20@FoodDive \"Post\")\n- ![Print this page](https://www.fooddive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/print.svg?440116200824)\n- [![Email this page](https://www.fooddive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/email.svg?092716141024)](mailto:?Subject=Mondel%C4%93z%20launches%20sugar-free%20Oreos%20to%20%E2%80%98disrupt%E2%80%99%20better-for-you%20snacking&Body=https%3A//www.fooddive.com/news/mondelez-launches-sugar-free-oreos-snacking/806067/ \"Email\")\n- [![License this article](https://www.fooddive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/cart.svg?092716141024)purchase licensing rights](https://www.fooddive.com/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl=https://www.fooddive.com/news/mondelez-launches-sugar-free-oreos-snacking/806067/ \"License\")\n\nFiled Under:[Ingredients,](https://www.fooddive.com/topic/ingredients/)[Corporate Operations](https://www.fooddive.com/topic/markets/)\n\n### Food Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\nEmail:\n\n- Select Newsletter:[ ] Daily DiveM-F\n- Select Newsletter:[ ] Ingredients WeeklyEvery Thursday\n- Select user consent:[ ]\nBy signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n[Terms of Use](https://www.informatechtarget.com/terms-of-use/) and\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.informatechtarget.com/privacy-policy/).

Credit: Oreo / Mondelez International\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience.Generate Key Takeaways\n\nMondelez International is rolling out its zero-sugar Oreos in the US next month, the snacks giant’s latest move to tap into “mindful indulgence”.\n\nThe company, which already sells the snacks in China and in markets in Europe, said a trial run in the US had convinced it to launch the product more widely in the new year.\n\nThe biscuits will go on sale in Original and Double Stuf options “nationwide”, the Oreo brand team said in a statement. The snacks have a suggested retail price of $5.79.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Oreo Zero Sugar presents a valuable opportunity for an iconic brand to truly disrupt the category, as well as expand the Oreo portfolio by providing more choices for consumers,” the statement read. “This innovation also reflects Mondelez International’s broader commitment to choice, offering options that cater to a wider range of lifestyles and dietary preferences.”\n\nThe products on sale in the US are sweetened with maltitol, polydextrose, sucralose and acesulfame potassium. “We took key learnings from other markets, like China and Europe, to refine our approach. From adjusting sweetness profiles to tailoring the product experience by launching a resealable standup pouch for added convenience, we’ve crafted a product that we feel is well suited for US consumers today,” the Oreo statement added.\n\nIn October, Mondelez [axed](https://www.just-food.com/news/mondelez-axes-better-for-you-fruitier-and-nuttier-cadbury-range/?cf-view) a ‘better-for-you’ dairy chocolate bar and snacking range in the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe low-sugar Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruitier and Nuttier Trail Mix, featuring a selection of chocolate buttons, fruit and nuts, was launched in 2023 and marketed as low in saturated fats, portion-controlled and with 127 calories. Chocolate bars under the same branding followed in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA statement read: “We worked incredibly hard to ensure that these better-for-you products retained the indulgence and great taste that consumers expect from Cadbury and, whilst the initial response from consumers was positive, sales and availability have significantly dropped.”\n\nTwo years ago, Mondelez [pulled from the market](https://www.just-food.com/news/mondelez-scraps-lower-sugar-cadbury-dairy-milk/) a version of its Cadbury Dairy Milk that contained 30% less sugar than the flagship bar.\n\nThe company launched the bars in 2019 as part of efforts to cut sugar in the products it sold in the UK and Ireland.\n\n\"Mondelez adds US to markets for zero-sugar Oreos\" was originally created and published by [Just Food](https://www.just-food.com/news/mondelez-adds-us-to-markets-for-zero-sugar-oreos/), a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n_The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

From January, Oreo Zero Sugar and Oreo Double Stuf Zero Sugar will become permanent additions to the company’s product range across the country.\n\nThis marks the first time Mondelez has introduced sugar-free Oreos to the U.S. market, though these varieties are already available in Europe and China. The move comes as the confectionery giant responds to what it identifies as a growing consumer desire for “mindful indulgence,” aiming to fill a notable gap in the market for sugar-free sandwich cookies.\n\nThe trend towards healthier snacking is gaining momentum across the industry. Earlier this year, market research firm Circana reported that a majority of Americans are actively seeking out snacks they perceive as “good for them.” Similarly, Conagra Brands, known for products like popcorn and Slim Jim, highlighted in a recent report that younger demographics, specifically Millennials and Generation Z, are increasingly prioritizing portion-controlled and wellness-focused snack choices.\n\n![Mondelez said it spent four years developing no-sugar Oreos so it could ensure the cookies still tasted like the originals.](https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/09/20/Zero_Sugar_Oreos_33242.jpg)\n\nMondelez said it spent four years developing no-sugar Oreos so it could ensure the cookies still tasted like the originals.(Oreo via AP)\n\nCoca-Cola Zero Sugar, which was introduced in 2017, saw sales jump 9% last year, while original Coke sales grew just 2%. Mondelez is also facing competition from Hershey, which sells zero sugar versions of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and other candies, and Voortman, a sugar-free wafer cookie brand.\n\nMondelez said it spent four years developing no-sugar Oreos so it could ensure the cookies still tasted like the originals. For sweetening, the Oreos contain maltitol, a type of sugar alcohol that’s also found in some fruits and vegetables; polydextrose, a soluble fiber; sucralose, a sweetener derived from sugar; and acesulfame potassium, a synthetic sweetener.\n\nComparing the nutrition data on Zero Sugar and regular Oreos is tricky, since the serving sizes differ.\n\nA serving of Oreo Zero Sugar cookies, which is defined as 22.6 grams, has 90 calories, 4.5 grams of fat and 16 grams of carbohydrates. A serving of regular Oreos, which is defined as three cookies or 34 grams, has 160 calories, 7 grams of fat and 25 grams of carbohydrates.\n\nThe biggest difference: a serving of regular Oreos contains 13 grams of added sugars, or 26% of the recommended daily amount. Zero Sugar Oreos contain none.\n\n### Thank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in\n\nstatic.independent.co.uk\n\n# static.independent.co.uk is blocked\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n- Try disabling your extensions.\n\nERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\n\nReload\n\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n![iiq_pixel](https://sync.intentiq.com/profiles_engine/ProfilesEngineServlet?at=20&mi=10&secure=1&dpi=1995923215&iiqidtype=2&iiqpcid=e6b72c1c-d157-07fc-0f60-f396140c510d&iiqpciddate=1765407764092&tsrnd=554_1765407764103&jsver=6.122&cz=0%3A992%2C1%3A1919%2C2%3A1%2C3%3A1080%2C4%3A1920%2C5%3Aen-US&dw=1920&dh=1080&dpr=1&lan=en-US&testPercentage=-1&testGroup=U&uh=%7B%220%22%3A%22%5C%22Chromium%5C%22%3Bv%3D%5C%22142%5C%22%2C%20%5C%22Google%20Chrome%5C%22%3Bv%3D%5C%22142%5C%22%2C%20%5C%22Not_A%20Brand%5C%22%3Bv%3D%5C%2299%5C%22%22%2C%221%22%3A%22%3F0%22%2C%222%22%3A%22%5C%22Windows%5C%22%22%2C%223%22%3A%22%5C%22x86%5C%22%22%2C%224%22%3A%22%5C%2264%5C%22%22%2C%226%22%3A%22%5C%226.8.0%5C%22%22%2C%227%22%3A%22%3F0%22%2C%228%22%3A%22%5C%22Chromium%5C%22%3Bv%3D%5C%22142.0.7444.162%5C%22%2C%20%5C%22Google%20Chrome%5C%22%3Bv%3D%5C%22142.0.7444.162%5C%22%2C%20%5C%22Not_A%20Brand%5C%22%3Bv%3D%5C%2299.0.0.0%5C%22%22%7D&vrref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk&gdpr_consent=undefined&gpc=undefined&gdpr=1)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n\nNotice Message App\n\nX\n\n![](https://static.independent.co.uk/static-assets/logo-no-text.svg)\n\n# Your privacy options\n\nThe Independent and our 103 [partners](https://cmpv2.independent.co.uk/index.html?hasCsp=true&message_id=1403484&consentUUID=null&consent_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcmpv2.independent.co.uk%2Fconsent%2Ftcfv2&preload_message=true&version=v1#) use cookies and other similar technologies to enable a variety of functions and features on our website. Some are essential for the website to work properly whilst others allow us to improve our services to you, which can include personalised content and advertising with your consent.

Athene sold $26.8 billion worth of annuities through Q3, a 4.3% decrease from last year.\n\nCorebridge Financial, Equitable Financial, and Allianz Life of North America rounded out the top five. Massachusetts Mutual Life took the biggest drop, falling from third place and $19.4 billion in annuity sales through Q3 2024, to eighth place and $14.3 billion in sales this year.\n\n![](https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-09-085337-900x588.png)\n\n[Total annuity sales increased 4% to $121.2 billion](https://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/ho-hum-q3-annuity-sales-set-yet-another-record-at-119b-limra-reports) in the third quarter of 2025, setting yet another quarterly sales record, LIMRA reported. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of $100+ billion in sales.\n\nYear-to-date annuity sales totaled $347 billion, up about 4% year-over-year. It marks the highest total ever recorded in a nine-month period, according to results from LIMRA’s U.S. Individual Annuity Sales Survey, which represents 89% of the total U.S. annuity market.\n\n[![](https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/LegalGeneral_970x90_2023-01.png)](https://insurancenewsnet.com/ads/legal-general-2023-01-super-leaderboard)\n\n“Registered annuity products – traditional variable annuities and registered index-linked annuities – posted double-digit growth, contributing to the overall growth in quarterly sales. Despite continued market volatility, the equity market's overall performance attracted investors looking to counter persistent inflation,” Bryan Hodgens, senior vice president and head of LIMRA research, said last month. “Although the Federal Reserve’s expected interest rate cuts will likely continue to dampen fixed annuity sales gains, LIMRA is projecting annuity sales to surpass $450 billion in 2025.”\n\nLIMRA released updated Q3 annuity sales numbers Tuesday:\n\n![](https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-09-090022-900x504.png)\n\n**© Entire contents copyright 2025 by InsuranceNewsNet.com Inc.

It recently earned the highest ranking in the J.D. Power U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Survey and is among the best homeowners insurers we've evaluated, offering comprehensive coverage and unique features.\n\n**Why Amica didn't make the cut:** Despite its strong reputation in other insurance areas, Amica's life insurance products are relatively unknown. The insurer isn't included in J.D. Power's U.S. Life Insurance Study and lacks NAIC complaint data. That being said, Amica offers affordable term life coverage (10-, 20-, and 30-year policies ranging from $11 to $25 per month), but has a limited selection of policies.\n\n[Read our full Amica Life Insurance review](https://money.com/amica-life-insurance-review/)\n\n* * *\n\n#### [Lemonade](https://money.com/pr/of7541f1dc35?ap_referrer=https%253A%252F%252Fmoney.com%252Fbest-life-insurance%252F)\n\nLemonade offers term life insurance with no medical exam. Customers can complete the full online application in around five minutes and purchase 10- to 30-year term policies with up to 1.5 million in coverage. Policyholders must download Lemonade’s mobile app to manage their policy, submit claims and access customer service.\n\n**Why Lemonade didn’t make the cut:** The company didn't make our top picks due to its limited insurance offerings and lack of detailed information about riders and policies on its website.\n\n* * *\n\n#### [MassMutual](https://money.com/pr/id0ea9b7407a?ap_referrer=https%253A%252F%252Fmoney.com%252Fbest-life-insurance%252F)\n\nMassMutual’s insurance portfolio includes term and permanent life insurance, including a term life policy that can be purchased online. Customers can also convert their term life insurance to a permanent policy without a medical exam. MassMutual features a life insurance calculator to help prospective clients assess their insurance needs.\n\n**Why MassMutual didn’t make the cut:** Unlike other insurers on top list, MassMutual offers few optional riders, so customers have limited options for policy customization.\n\n[Read our full MassMutual Life Insurance review](https://money.com/massmutual-life-insurance-review/)\n\n* * *\n\n#### [USAA](https://money.com/pr/r6bd73d23b3a?ap_referrer=https%253A%252F%252Fmoney.com%252Fbest-life-insurance%252F)\n\nUSAA offers various life insurance options, including term and permanent coverage. Policies start at $12 a month and coverage amounts go up to $10 million. Additionally, policyholders receive complimentary survivor assistance and the option for disability protection. There's also simplified whole life coverage available for children.\n\n**Why USAA didn’t make the cut:** The company's website lacks comprehensive information about available riders and cash value policies.

Drinking, smoking, and high-risk activities lead to higher premiums, as do chronic health conditions and risky occupations like roofing or construction.\n\n### Types of life insurance policies\n\n[Life insurance](https://money.com/life-insurance-beginners/?amp%3Bref=%2Fbest-life-insurance%2F) is a contract where the insurer promises to pay a death benefit to the policy's [beneficiary](https://money.com/choosing-a-life-insurance-beneficiary/?amp%3Bref=%2Fbest-life-insurance%2F) upon the policyholder's death. This benefit is funded by the policyholder's lifetime premium payments.\n\nLife insurance policies fall into two main categories:\n\n- **[Permanent life insurance](https://money.com/what-is-permanent-life-insurance/)** \\- Policies last your entire life and may have a cash value component that can be accessed for various purposes. Learn more about permanent policies through our guides on [whole life insurance](https://money.com/whole-life-insurance-guide/), [universal life insurance](https://money.com/universal-life-insurance-guide/), [variable life insurance](https://money.com/what-is-permanent-life-insurance/#:~:text=With%20a%20variable%20life%20insurance,your%20policy%20may%20grow%20faster.) and [joint life insurance](https://money.com/what-is-joint-life-insurance/).\n\n- **[Term life insurance](https://money.com/what-is-term-life-insurance/)** \\- Provides coverage for a set number of years — anywhere from 10 to 40 — and does not include a cash value (final expense insurance falls in this category). Read more about this option on our [term life insurance](https://money.com/what-is-term-life-insurance/#types) guide.\n\nFor term or whole life coverage without a medical exam, consider a simplified or guaranteed issue policy. Read more about this option on our guide to [no-exam life insurance](https://money.com/what-is-no-exam-life-insurance/).\n\n### How to compare life insurance policies\n\nWhen comparing the best life insurers, consider the following factors.\n\n1. **Policy types:** Check if the insurer offers both term and permanent life insurance options. Some newer insurers, especially those online, may focus on term life and guaranteed-issue policies.\n2. **Application process:** Determine if the application is entirely online or if you need to work with an agent during underwriting.\n3. **Medical exam requirements:** Understand whether a medical exam is necessary. Some companies offer no-exam life insurance.\n4. **Riders:** Check if the policy can be enhanced with riders. Some companies include riders in the policy, while others sell them separately. Availability varies.\n5. **Coverage:** Note the minimum and maximum coverage amounts offered. These can vary significantly among insurers.\n6. **Pricing:** Compare life insurance premiums from different insurers. Prices vary based on how they assess risk. It's best to get quotes from multiple companies.\n7. **Company reputation:** To ensure the company is reputable, check AM Best for financial strength ratings, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for customer complaints, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) for customer reviews and the latest J.D. Power Individual Life Insurance Study for industry rankings.\n\n### How to purchase life insurance\n\n#### 1\\. Understand how different types of life insurance policies work\n\nLearn the differences between [term versus whole life insurance](https://money.com/term-vs-whole-life-insurance/). Term life may suit young, healthy individuals who want income replacement for a specific period, such as the duration of a mortgage. [Permanent life insurance](https://money.com/what-is-permanent-life-insurance/) offers lifetime coverage and growth potential but higher premiums.\n\n#### 2\\. Choose a policy term\n\nIf you're sold on term life insurance, your next step should be to [choose a life insurance term length](https://money.com/choosing-a-life-insurance-term/). To do so, consider how long you need to provide for your dependents and the duration of any other financial obligations. Remember that the longer the term, the higher the premium.\n\n#### 3\\. Determine how much coverage you need\n\nTo determine [how much life insurance you really need](https://money.com/how-much-life-insurance-do-you-need/), add up potential end-of-life expenses, family lifestyle adjustments, debts and hidden income (e.g., employer benefits). Then, subtract potential income sources (e.g., Social Security) and adjust for inflation.\n\n#### 4\\. Shop for quotes\n\nOnce you've decided on a type of policy and coverage amount, get life insurance quotes from several different companies. Insurers price risk differently, so you could get widely different estimates based on your age, gender, health and lifestyle.\n\n#### 5\\. Make an apples-to-apples comparison\n\nWhen comparing policies, request quotes for the same policy type, term length (if applicable), and coverage amount. Factor in unique features, optional riders, and discounts. Also, weigh insurers' reputation for customer service and financial stability.\n\nAds by Money.

Power in the latest U.S. Life Insurance Satisfaction Study\n\n- Studied complaints regarding their individual life insurance policies, based on National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) data\n\nWe also interviewed representatives from various companies. While we strive for accuracy in regulatory and legal information, it may not be complete or fully up to date.\n\n## Latest News\n\nMore insurance companies are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into their day-to-day operations, but customers aren't convinced that the technology will work to their benefit, according to J.D. Power's [Artificial Intelligence and Insurance Pulse Survey](https://www.jdpower.com/business/resources/insurance-customers-keep-open-mind-artificial-intelligence-some-notable). Just 26% of respondents believe AI tools will benefit customers and providers equally, and 68% believe that insurance companies stand to benefit the most from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe survey also measured customers' comfort levels with AI usage for specific processes like calculating premiums, communicating with policyholders and customer service chats. Respondents were most comfortable with insurers using AI for routine steps like automated claim status updates, billing and even answering basic customer service questions. The same cannot be said for important decisions: Nearly half feel uneasy about their insurers using AI to process claims.\n\nCustomers are particularly concerned about using AI to calculate premiums. Thirty percent of respondents said there should only be partial use of AI in pricing, and only as long as there are ironclad safeguards in place. About one-third want limited AI use until the industry can guarantee the technology won't introduce biases or violate ethical standards.\n\n## Best Life Insurance FAQs\n\n### What is the best life insurance?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nThe best life insurance for you is one that aligns with your particular financial situation. Before choosing a plan, assess how you plan to use the policy. Do you need coverage for funeral expenses or want to ensure your family’s financial stability in your absence? For more information, explore our step-by-step guide to choosing a policy.\n\n### How much is life insurance per month?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nThe cost of a life insurance policy will depend on factors such as the applicant's age, sex and overall health as well as the type of policy and coverage amount they select. Monthly premiums typically range from $20 to over $300. Our [section on the cost of life insurance](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#cost) includes sample rates for permanent and term life insurance policies.\n\n### What is the cash value of a life insurance policy?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nPermanent life insurance, like whole or universal policies, builds cash value over time. You can use this cash value to borrow against your policy, cover premiums, or buy more coverage. If you don't repay a loan before your death, the outstanding amount is deducted from the death benefit.\n\n### Can you get life insurance if you have cancer?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nCancer patients may be eligible for a no-exam, guaranteed issue permanent life insurance policy. These skip the medical exam, ensuring guaranteed approval with most carriers. However, premiums are typically higher, and coverage amounts usually range from $50,000 to $100,000. While some policies have waiting periods, others offer immediate coverage.\n\n## Summary of Money’s Best Life Insurance Companies of December 2025\n\n- [Ethos](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#ethos) \\- Best for Same-Day Coverage\n- [Ladder](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#ladder) \\- Best for Flexible Coverage\n- [Lantern](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#lantern) \\- Best for Instant Term Life Quotes Online\n- [Nationwide](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#nationwide) \\- Best for Bundling Discounts\n- [New York Life](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#ny-life) \\- Best Whole Life Insurance\n- [Northwestern Mutual](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#northwestern-mutual) \\- Best for Policy Customization\n- [Policygenius](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#policygenius) \\- Best Online Life Insurance Broker\n- [State Farm](https://money.com/best-life-insurance/#state-farm) \\- Best for Customer Satisfaction and Stability\n\nthis link is to an external site that may or may not meet accessibility guidelines."

Here's what you need to know about common types.\n\n### **Term life insurance**\n\nIf you want to make sure your debts are covered, [term life insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-term-life-insurance/) is a convenient and affordable option at any age, and your plan may be convertible to a whole life policy. Once you reach age 60, however, the longest term you'll typically find is for 20 years.\n\nGet first-rate term life insurance at a reasonable rate\n\nOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.\n\n![](https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/product_select/2024/03/29/Amica_Logo.png)\n\n![](https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/product_select/2024/03/29/Amica_Logo.png)[Amica Life Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/rb8b57ff27ae)\n\nHighlights\n\nAmica offers a level term life insurance and whole life insurance policies payable for 20 years or until ages 65 or 100.

The rates are considerably higher than term life, but it can be an option if your focus is on leaving a financial legacy to your loved ones.\n\n### **Universal life insurance**\n\nLike whole life, [universal life policies](https://www.cnbc.com/select/universal-life-insurance-what-is-it-how-does-it-work/) have a cash value component. But, because they're linked to investments that either you or your insurance company chooses, they require more oversight. If you don't monitor the cash value, the policy could become underfunded and either get cancelled or require you to make large payments to keep it active.\n\n### **Final expense insurance**\n\nAlso known as pre-need, funeral or [burial insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-burial-insurance-companies/), final expense insurance is a popular option for seniors who don't want to leave the burden of a burial, outstanding medical or legal bills or other expenses to their loved ones.\n\nIt's a guaranteed-issue whole life policy, so you don't have to worry about it expiring or having to get approved or take a medical exam. But a final expense policy can be expensive, especially since payouts are usually limited to $5,000 to $25,000.\n\n## Pros and cons of life insurance for seniors\n\nPros\n\n- Can pay for a funeral and other final expenses\n- Can pay off debts or leave a financial legacy for your family or community\n- Permanent life insurance can create a revenue stream in retirement\n\nCons\n\n- It may be harder to get approved\n- Premiums are more expensive\n- Coverage options are more limited\n\n## How to choose life insurance as a senior\n\nIf you're buying life insurance after age 65, consider these factors when deciding what type is right for you\n\n- **Your budget:** Life insurance in your 60s, 70s or beyond will be more expensive than in your 40s. You may be tempted to get a policy [without a medical exam](https://www.cnbc.com/select/no-exam-life-insurance/), but that could mean your premiums are even higher.\n\n- **Your goals:** Are you buying insurance to pay off the mortgage or even cover daily expenses? Are you interested in leaving your family some money for their future or just enough for a funeral? Your answers will steer you toward the right policy.\n\n- **Your health status:** Do you have a pre-existing condition that could keep you from getting approved? If so, you may want to narrow your search to guaranteed-issue whole life or universal life policies that don't require a medical exam.\n\n## Life insurance for seniors FAQs\n\n### How old can you be and still get life insurance?\n\nIt's possible to buy life insurance at any age, depending on the policy and the provider. The typical maximum age for term life is 85, while some whole life and universal policies are available up to age 90. You can get a final expense or guaranteed issue policy past age 85, though premiums will be considerably higher.\n\n### What is the best life insurance for seniors over 70?\n\nThe best life insurance for someone over 70 depends on their health, their budget and their goals. If you're concerned about being approved, you could buy a guaranteed issue policy without a medical exam or health questions that would pay enough to cover [final expenses](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-burial-insurance-companies/). If you have more to spend or want to create a financial legacy, a whole life policy could make sense.\n\n### Who has the best life insurance for seniors?\n\nThe best life insurance company for seniors depends on what kind of coverage you want, how much you have to spend and your goals for the payout. We've found that [Pacific Life](https://secure.money.com/pr/tc64c4d5ef2a), [Mutual of Omaha](https://secure.money.com/pr/o18f2f96e940), [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/b9877012b33a), [AARP](https://www.nylaarp.com/), [Guardian](https://secure.money.com/pr/p1813f8cc940), [Prudential](https://secure.money.com/pr/d563de1b9827) and [MassMutual](https://secure.money.com/pr/gb55358d1ed8) are among the leading providers for seniors, with higher maximum issue ages, reasonable rates and solid financial strength.\n\n### Is life insurance worth it for seniors?\n\nLife insurance can be an invaluable financial tool for seniors. Even if the house is paid up and the kids are grown, a life insurance policy can [pay for a funeral](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-burial-insurance-companies/), protect your spouse, give a gift to your heirs or [provide for long-term care](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-long-term-care-insurance/).\n\n**Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!**\n\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

Provisioning time dropped from weeks to minutes, while a consistent desktop experience supports faster onboarding, business continuity, and future AI readiness.\n\n![New York Life Insurance Company](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/24779_New%20York%20Life%20Insurance%20Company%20Story%20Thumbnail?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=250&qlt=100)\n\n“With Windows 365, colleagues start their first day with a fully ready and optimized endpoint. That kind of consistency and care in the digital experience reflects how we operate as a company. Being able to deliver that through the Microsoft ecosystem is a big part of what gives us a competitive advantage.”\n\nKevin Glynn, Chief Technology Officer, New York Life\n\nWith 180 years of resilience behind it, New York Life Insurance Company understands that staying competitive means continuously evolving. As workforces become more distributed and digital experiences more critical, the Fortune 100 mutual life insurer needed a modern desktop strategy that could scale and adapt. With a nationwide hybrid workforce and a portfolio spanning the company’s Foundational and Strategic Businesses, New York Life faced a critical turning point as it sought to reimagine its on-premises Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). The company was also seeking more flexibility in how and where work gets done, while keeping systems secure and scalable. New York Life needed a desktop solution that could support its diverse personas—including employees, the company’s field force of 12,000 agents and advisors, consultants, managed service providers, and global affiliates—without disrupting day-to-day operations.\n\n### Tailoring Cloud PCs to every persona\n\nTo replace its existing VDI and simplify IT delivery at scale, New York Life turned to a cloud-first solution that avoided the complexity of traditional virtualization. The company selected [Windows 365](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365) to deliver Cloud PCs consistently and securely for more than 7,000 users, including knowledge workers, contractors, and call center agents. This approach also supports secure and fast access for third-party collaborators by limiting data exposure and delivering virtual endpoints quickly. Manoj Doshi, Head of End User Compute at New York Life, and his team adopted a persona-driven model, tailoring desktop configurations to match each role's unique security, performance, and application needs. “With Windows 365, the biggest impact was how little training we needed,” he notes. “Most people moved from physical devices without missing a step. The experience was seamless.”\n\n“With Windows 365, the biggest impact was how little training we needed. Most people moved from physical devices without missing a step. The experience was seamless.”\n\nManoj Doshi, Head of End User Compute, New York Life\n\nTo support this flexible desktop strategy, New York Life relies on [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-intune) to manage both physical and cloud-based devices. “Intune is the core of everything we do,” says Doshi. “From an administration perspective, we don’t have to have multiple teams. It’s a single team managing that.” The centralized management model simplifies provisioning and strengthens security across every user type.\n\nSecurity was a top concern throughout the implementation. “Windows 365 met the criteria for providing secure, seamless access and allowed us to become more proactive rather than reactive,” says Reshma Budhwani, Chief Technology Security Officer at New York Life. Because the company operates in a highly regulated industry, protecting sensitive customer data and meeting strict access controls were non-negotiable. Windows 365 helped enforce those standards through consistent, company-wide policies. “It helped us implement strong conditional access policies and endpoint protection consistently, no matter where our people are working,” Budhwani adds. This reduced the risk of data loss or unauthorized access across remote and third-party endpoints. New York Life balances strong security with high performance, so the business can move quickly without compromise.\n\n“Windows 365 met the criteria for providing secure, seamless access and allowed us to become more proactive rather than reactive.

With deployment complete, New York Life reports measurable gains in efficiency, responsiveness, and business continuity. “We’ve cut provisioning time dramatically,” says Hemal Patel, CIO of Strategic Businesses. “What used to take weeks now takes minutes. That kind of speed really matters during high-volume periods like open enrollment and onboarding.” The rollout took about four months, making day-one productivity a reality. The experience is consistent worldwide, whether employees work in the US, Asia-Pacific, or anywhere else.\n\nWith Windows 365 and Intune, a smaller IT team can handle more endpoints without compromising security or compliance. “We’re managing more with fewer resources because the Windows 365 environment is consistent and secure by design,” says Patel. Built-in security features support compliance and helped the team phase out legacy systems. High availability and disaster recovery keep employees connected, while a consistent Windows experience across devices minimizes disruption and maintains productivity.\n\n“With Windows 365, colleagues start their first day with a fully ready and optimized endpoint,” says Kevin Glynn, Chief Technology Officer at New York Life. “That kind of consistency and care in the digital experience reflects how we operate as a company. Being able to deliver that through the Microsoft ecosystem is a big part of what gives us a competitive advantage.”\n\nDeepening its investment in modern work, New York Life recently completed a [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/) rollout to 13,000 employees. “Copilot is helping people get out of blank-page mode,” Glynn says. “It’s changing how people start their workday and how they think about tackling tasks.” Patel sees Copilot as part of a broader Microsoft toolkit that includes [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). “These tools are helping us build a digitally fluent, AI-ready workforce,” he says. “That foundation sets us up to stay competitive.”\n\nWith Copilot’s productivity gains on the horizon and a secure, scalable desktop infrastructure already in place, New York Life is positioning itself not just to keep pace with change, but to lead it. Grounded in legacy and fueled by innovation, the company’s dedication to its people and mission creates an environment where careers can thrive long term. “Windows 365 has given us the modern desktop foundation we need to build for the future,” concludes Patel.\n\nDiscover more about [New York Life Insurance

In addition, drivers in New York must have uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage and personal injury protection.\n\n- **[Bodily injury liability (BI)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage \"Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?\"):** $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident, plus double for death\n\n- **[Property damage liability (PD)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance \"What Is Property Damage Liability Car Insurance?\"):** $10,000 per accident\n\n- **[Uninsured motorist bodily injury (UMBI)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance \"Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance\"):** $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident, plus double for death\n\n- **[Personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/how-pip-works-new-york \"How Does Personal Injury Protection (PIP) Work in New York?\"):** $50,000 per accident\n\n\n### Supplemental spousal liability insurance NY\n\nAll auto insurance policies for married drivers in New York automatically include a new coverage called supplemental spousal liability insurance (SSLI), as of August 2023.\n\nThis coverage allows you to make a claim against your spouse's insurance if you're hurt in an accident while they're driving.\n\n**Your supplemental spousal liability insurance limit is typically the same as your bodily injury liability limit.** However, you can only use this coverage once you've used all of your personal injury protection (PIP) coverage.\n\nYou can decline supplemental spousal liability insurance by contacting your insurance company and filling out a [form stating you're turning down this coverage](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/02/auto_insurers_supp_spousal_liability_insurance_declination_form.pdf \"Supplemental Spousal Liability Insurance Declination Form\").\n\nHow much does supplemental spousal liability coverage cost?\n\nSupplemental spousal liability insurance costs an average of $22 per year.\n\nHowever the cost varies by company. For example, Allstate doesn't charge extra for this coverage. But Geico customers pay an additional $73 per year for the coverage, on average.\n\n#### Average cost of supplemental spousal liability insurance\n\n| Company | Annual cost |\n| --- | --- |\n| Allstate | $0 |\n| Progressive | $2 |\n| Erie | $6 |\n| USAA | $14 |\n| State Farm | $23 |\n| Geico | $73 |\n\n![award icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/award)\n\n### What's the best car insurance coverage to get in New York?\n\nMost New York drivers should get full coverage car insurance, which includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance \"Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance\").\n\n**If you have a car loan or lease, your lender typically requires you to have these coverages.** That's because they pay for damage to your car in many situations, regardless of whose fault it is. You should also consider adding comprehensive and collision coverage if your car is less than eight years old or worth more than $5,000.\n\nIn addition, full coverage policies typically have higher liability limits than the state requirement. **Higher liability limits are a good idea because New York's required limits may not be high enough to pay for a serious accident.**\n\nFor example, New York only required $10,000 of property damage liability insurance. If you crash into a Tesla and the other car is totaled, $10,000 won't be enough to fully replace the other driver's car.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### How much are car insurance rates in New York?\n\nThe average cost of auto insurance in New York state is $226 per month for a full coverage policy. That's $14 more per month than the national average.

That's 44% less than the statewide average. [NYCM](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-new-york#liability \"Cheapest minimum liability car insurance in New York\") has the cheapest minimum coverage insurance in NY, at just $44 per month.\n\n### Why is car insurance so expensive in New York?\n\nNew York is the fourth-most expensive state for minimum-coverage insurance, and the 11th most expensive for full coverage. This is in part because New York is a [no-fault state](https://www.valuepenguin.com/fault-or-no-fault-accident-decision-affects-auto-insurance-claims \"Fault vs No Fault Accidents and Auto Insurance Claims\"), which means drivers need to have personal injury protection. This coverage can be expensive. In addition, many areas in New York have heavy traffic congestion, which can lead to more accidents.\n\n* * *\n\n## Methodology\n\nTo find the best cheap auto insurance in New York state, ValuePenguin collected quotes from the largest NY auto insurance companies across all ZIP codes in the state. Quotes are for a 30-year-old man with good credit who owns a 2018 Honda Civic EX.\n\nRates are for a full coverage policy with comprehensive and collision coverage, along with higher liability limits than required for New York drivers. Rates don't include supplemental spousal liability coverage.\n\n\\[list\\\n$50,000 of bodily injury liability coverage per person and $100,000 per accident\\\n$50,000 of property damage liability\\\n$50,000 of bodily injury uninsured motorist coverage per person and $100,000 per accident\\\n$50,000 of personal injury protection\\\nCollision and comprehensive coverage with a $500 deductible\\\n\\[/list\\]\\\n\\\nValuePenguin's analysis used insurance rate data from Quadrant Information Services. These rates were publicly sourced from insurance company filings and should be used for comparative purposes only.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.6%, which is fairly typical for the industry.\n\n[AI is about to change healthcare.

Prior to this announcement, WEC Energy Group's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 19.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 62% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\n[![historic-dividend](<Base64-Image-Removed>)](https://simplywall.st/company/id/43EF6B62-74FC-46A3-A3DE-6DF82099588B/dividend?blueprint=4267453&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo)\n\nNYSE:WEC Historic Dividend December 8th 2025\n\n[View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group](https://simplywall.st/company/id/43EF6B62-74FC-46A3-A3DE-6DF82099588B?blueprint=4267453&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n## WEC Energy Group Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.69 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.81. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.5% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.\n\n## We Could See WEC Energy Group's Dividend Growing\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that WEC Energy Group has grown earnings per share at 6.4% per year over the past five years. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.\n\n## Our Thoughts On WEC Energy Group's Dividend\n\nOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While WEC Energy Group is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

(NYSE:WEC)](https://www.investing.com/equities/wisconsin-energy-corp) announced Thursday that its Board of Directors’ Compensation Committee has established performance measures for the company’s 2026 executive annual incentive and performance unit compensation plans. The information was disclosed in a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFor the 2026 plan year, the annual incentive for named executive officers (NEOs) will be based primarily on financial performance, with 75% of the award tied to earnings per share and 25% to cash flow. Awards may be adjusted by up to 10% depending on results in customer satisfaction (5%), safety (2.5%), and supplier diversity and workforce development (2.5%) across all WEC Energy Group companies.\n\nFor NEOs whose roles focus on Wisconsin utility operations, the 2026 incentive will be based on three financial measures: WEC Energy Group’s earnings per share (25%), cash flow (25%), and the aggregate net income of the company’s Wisconsin utility operations (50%). For these executives, awards may also be adjusted by up to 10% based on customer satisfaction (5%), safety (2.5%), supplier diversity (1.25%), and workforce development (1.25%).\n\nThe Compensation Committee also set the performance measures for the 2026 performance unit awards under the company’s Performance Unit Plan. These awards will be determined by WEC Energy Group’s total shareholder return over a three-year period compared to a peer group (55% weighting) and performance against the weighted average authorized return on equity of all utility subsidiaries (45% weighting). The Committee included a provision allowing the vesting percentage to increase by up to 25% based on the company’s stock price to earnings ratio relative to peers. The maximum vesting percentage is capped at 200% of the target award.\n\nThese compensation plan changes were approved by the Compensation Committee on Thursday and are effective for the 2026 plan year. The announcement was made in a press release statement filed with the SEC.\n\nIn other recent news, WEC Energy Group reported impressive financial results for the third quarter of 2025, surpassing analysts’ expectations with earnings per share of $0.83, compared to the anticipated $0.81. The company’s revenue also exceeded forecasts, coming in at $2.14 billion against the expected $1.91 billion. Additionally, WEC Energy Group has announced a significant $3 billion equity distribution agreement, allowing the sale of its common stock through various financial institutions. In another development, the company has entered into an agreement for a $600 million notes offering with a 5.625% interest rate, set to mature in 2056. The board of directors plans a 6.7% increase in the quarterly dividend to 95.25 cents per share, payable in the first quarter of 2026. Jefferies has raised its price target for WEC Energy Group to $124, maintaining a Hold rating, citing the company’s solid earnings growth and rate base CAGR. These recent developments reflect WEC Energy Group’s strategic financial maneuvers and robust performance.\n\n_This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The recent slide reflects renewed concerns around opioid litigation and retail pharmacy market softness, but sharp drops like this often raise a tougher question: is the weakness temporary, or a sign of deeper cracks in the story?\n\nBefore judging its **downturn reslience**, let's look at where Cencora stands today.\n\n**Consider the following data**\n\n- **Size**: Cencora is a $65 Bil company with $321 Bil in revenue currently trading at $337.29.\n- **Fundamentals**: Last 12 month revenue growth of 9.3% and operating margin of 1.2%.\n- **Liquidity**: Has Debt to Equity ratio of 0.13 and Cash to Assets ratio of 0.06\n- **Valuation**: Cencora stock is currently trading at P/E multiple of 42.1 and P/EBIT multiple of 22.6\n- null\n\nThese metrics point to a **Moderate operational performance**, alongside **Moderate** valuation - making the stock **Fairly Priced**. For details, see [Buy or Sell COR Stock](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/COR/no-login-required/bWaHVdG2/Should-You-Buy-Cencora-Stock-)\n\nThat brings us to the key consideration for investors worried about this fall: how **resilient** is COR stock if markets turn south? This is where our **downturn resilience** framework comes in. Suppose COR stock **falls another 20-30%** to $236 - can investors comfortably hold on? Turns out, the stock **has been more resilient than** the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns, based on (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. Below, we dive deeper into each such downturn.\n\n## **Downturn Resilience: COR Performance During Market Crises**\n\n**2022 Inflation Shock**\n\n- COR stock fell 18.3% from a high of $165.73 on 20 April 2022 to $135.33 on 30 September 2022 vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500.\n- However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 25 November 2022\n- Since then, the stock increased to a high of $374.75 on 25 November 2025 , and currently trades at $337.29\n\n|  | COR | S&P 500 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| % Change from Pre-Recession Peak | -18.3% | -25.4% |\n| Time to Full Recovery | 56 days | 464 days |\n\n**2020 Covid Pandemic**\n\n- COR stock fell 23.8% from a high of $97.00 on 21 February 2020 to $73.93 on 23 March 2020 vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500.\n- However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 2 June 2020\n\n|  | COR | S&P 500 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| % Change from Pre-Recession Peak | -23.8% | -33.9% |\n| Time to Full Recovery | 71 days | 148 days |\n\n**2018 Correction**\n\n- COR stock fell 32.9% from a high of $105.48 on 26 January 2018 to $70.76 on 24 December 2018 vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 19.8% for the S&P 500.\n- However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 November 2020\n\n|  | COR | S&P 500 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| % Change from Pre-Recession Peak | -32.9% | -19.8% |\n| Time to Full Recovery | 686 days | 120 days |\n\n**2008 Global Financial Crisis**\n\n- COR stock fell 51.2% from a high of $28.18 on 24 April 2007 to $13.74 on 20 November 2008 vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500.\n- However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 2 February 2010\n\n|  | COR | S&P 500 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| % Change from Pre-Recession Peak | -51.2% | -56.8% |\n| Time to Full Recovery | 439 days | 1480 days |\n\nFeeling jittery about COR stock? Consider **portfolio approach**\n\n## **Move Beyond Single Stocks With A Multi Asset Portfolio**\n\nIndividual picks are volatile but diversified assets offset each other.

However, intense competition is a concern.\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 50.1% so far this year compared with the industry’s 5.7% gain. The S&P 500 Index has jumped 18.7% in the same time frame.\n\nCencora is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical service companies. It is focused on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. The company has a market capitalization of $65.53 billion.\n\n![Zacks Investment Research](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/zacks:eb4a77fa1094b-352212f869529ab984bf64c8ed215623-resized.webp)\n\nCOR’s bottom line is anticipated to improve 11.9% over the next five years. Its earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 5.51%.\n\n**Positive Factors Driving COR’s Prospects**\n\n**Strong U.S. Healthcare Solutions Momentum, Especially in Specialty:** Cencora’s U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment delivered 25% operating income growth, supported by robust utilization trends, strong specialty volumes, and favorable biosimilar conversion in physician practices and health systems. Management emphasized broad-based strength across the U.S. business and superior execution as key contributors.\n\n**Strategic Boost From RCA Acquisition:** The acquisition of Retina Consultants of America (“RCA”) is meaningfully expanding gross profit and operating income, aided by high-margin specialty services. RCA demonstrated stronger-than-expected integration, strong cultural alignment and reinforced Cencora’s leadership in retina and broader specialty distribution. Management sees RCA as a long-term growth engine with expanding therapeutic opportunities.\n\n**Raised FY25 Guidance Reflects Business Outperformance:** COR issued its fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS outlook to be in the $17.45-$17.75 range, implying 9-11% growth. Adjusted operating income is expected to improve 8-10% for fiscal 2026, likely to be driven by the exceptional U.S. segment performance. Consistent upward revisions indicate underlying demand strength and operational leverage.\n\n**Continued Investment in Digital Transformation and Capabilities:** Management highlighted ongoing investments in digital infrastructure, analytics, productivity programs, and strategic growth areas such as specialty distribution and MSO platforms (RCA, OneOncology). These investments are expected to enhance operational efficiency, deepen customer integration and sustain long-term competitive advantage.\n\n**Negative Factors Hurting COR**\n\n**Weakness in International Healthcare Solutions:** The international segment continues to face declines in global specialty logistics and consulting, caused by subdued clinical trial activity and slower-than-expected recovery in biotech services. The operating income for the segment was down 2% in the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2025, worse than previous expectations.\n\n**GLP-1 Growth Moderation and Loss of Low-Margin Revenue Sources:** Although GLP-1 sales remain strong, their growth has slowed to 19%, down from earlier periods, weakening one of the company’s major drivers of top-line expansion.Additionally, COR lost a large grocery-channel customer — high revenues but very low margin — which is weighing on reported revenue growth. These factors led the company to trim its U.S. revenue outlook to the lower end of the range.\n\n**Estimate Trend**\n\nCOR has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2026. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has increased from $17.37 to $17.66 per share.\n\nThe consensus mark for first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $85.89 billion, indicating a 5.4% improvement from the year-ago reported actuals. The bottom-line estimate is pinned at $4.05, implying year-over-year growth of 8.6%.\n\n**Cencora, Inc. Price**\n\nCencora, Inc. price \\| Cencora, Inc. Quote\n\n**Other Stocks to Consider**\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are **Medpace Holdings** MEDP, **Intuitive Surgical** ISRG and **Veracyte** VCYT.\n\nMedpace, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2, reported third-quarter 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of $3.86, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.29%.

She said the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the US Coast Guard, “with support from the Department of War, executed a seizure warrant for a crude oil tanker used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.”\n\n“For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations. This seizure, completed off the coast of Venezuela, was conducted safely and securely—and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues,” Bondi wrote.\n\nThe president did not offer any detailed explanation for the move, saying only that it was seized “for very good reason.” Asked what would happen to the oil the tanker was transporting, Trump said, “We keep it, I guess.”\n\nThe seizure occurred in international waters, a senior US official said, and proceeded without incident or casualties either among the US personnel or the tanker’s crew.\n\nThe vessel, named the Skipper, was carrying Venezuelan crude, the official said. The tanker had been previously associated with Iranian oil, and a federal judge issued a warrant for its seizure because of those links.\n\nThe move risks further escalating tensions with Venezuela, where Trump has intensified a pressure campaign aimed at [forcing the nation’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, out of power](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/politics/trump-plans-after-maduro?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn). The ship, which was headed to Cuba, was ultimately destined for Asia after being brokered through Cuban sellers, the senior official said, adding that additional seizures are possible in the coming weeks as the US applies pressure on Maduro.\n\nIn response to questions from CNN’s Kristen Holmes, Trump said he had not spoken to Maduro recently and declined to say who owns the seized tanker.\n\nCuba has already been grappling with some of the worst power outages in decades, with blackouts stretching for hours, sometimes days. The communist-run island’s aging energy infrastructure is dependent on oil imports, often in the form of donations coming from allies like Venezuela, Russia and Mexico. The Cuban government had no immediate response to news of the seizure of the tanker of oil heading to the island.\n\nThe US is now months into its pressure campaign on Venezuela that has included moving thousands of troops and a carrier strike group into the Caribbean, strikes on suspected drug boats and repeated threats against Maduro. So far, the US military has [killed 87 people in strikes](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) that have destroyed 23 alleged drug boats, and Trump has repeatedly suggested action on land could come soon.\n\nCNN has reported the Trump administration is working on day-after plans in the event Maduro is ousted from power, according to two senior administration officials and another source familiar with the discussions.\n\nMaduro did not address the seized tanker in a speech Wednesday that was occurring as news of the US’s move was circulating.\n\n_This is a developing story and will be updated._\n\nCNN’s Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at [CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn&registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters)\n\n![President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on December 10.](https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1S6lQV.img?w=768&h=432&m=6&x=441&y=162&s=141&d=141)\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on December 10.© Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n![Expand article logo](https://assets.msn.com/staticsb/statics/latest/views/icons/textExpand_filled.svg)   Continue reading\n\n[Sponsored](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759)\n\n[![CNN](https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1neFU6.img?w=56&h=56&q=60&m=2&f=jpg)](http://www.cnn.com/ \"Go to publisher's site\") [Visit CNN](http://www.cnn.com/ \"Go to publisher's site\") [Go to publisher's site](http://www.cnn.com/ \"Go to publisher's site\")\n\nMichigan fires head football coach Sherrone Moore after investigation into alleged inappropriate relationship with staffer\n\nEnergy drink dangers, flooding fears, ski lift rescue: Catch up on the day’s stories\n\n[Sponsored](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759)\n\n## Sponsored Content\n\n## More for You\n\n[Community Guidelines](https://www.msn.com/en-us/community/guideline \"Community Guidelines\") Close\n\n[![Profile Picture](https://assets.msn.com/staticsb/statics//latest/community/img/avatar-placeholder.svg)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/community/profile/me \"Profile Picture\")"

At the same time, companies are prioritising regional suppliers and expanding across Asia-Pacific to enhance cold chain reliability.\n\n## Strategic infrastructure expansion\n\nCencora’s announcement of new investments to advance its 3PL capabilities across the US and Europe underscores a broader shift toward geographically diversified distribution networks. The company is strengthening its pan-European footprint through the integration of NextPharma Logistics – a [healthcare logistics](https://supplychaindigital.com/operations/top-10-healthcare-supply-chains) provider operating in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nCencora will also open a 3PL facility in Italy in 2026, following recent expansions in France, Spain and the UK. These developments signal an industry-wide recognition that access to advanced therapies depends on highly localised infrastructure compliant with stringent Good Distribution Practice (GDP) standards.\n\nThe scale of expansion underway suggests pharmaceutical manufacturers are working to de-risk supply chains through partnerships with logistics providers offering broad, multi-market capabilities.\n\n\"Our customers trust us to serve as an extension of their operations,\" says Chris Williams, SVP and President of Alloga Europe & ICS.\n\n![](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/668/9b78c5f859c4f5608e6db43ec3f8aa20:45364c97d489b16de1b6d1af20b5e2eb/1703093081955.jpg)\n\nChris Williams, SVP and President of Alloga Europe & ICS\n\n\"We continue to strengthen our pharmaceutical logistics capabilities through investments across our 3PL network to deliver enhanced support tailored to their needs.\n\n\"Whether it's a large-scale global program or supporting the launch of an advanced therapy in a new market, we're able to provide the integrated support our customers need to navigate supply chain complexities, maximize commercial success and ensure efficient and reliable access to their products.\"\n\n## Cold chain technology demands\n\nThe commercialisation of cell and gene therapies is driving exceptional demand for ultra-low and cryogenic storage capacity. Cencora plans to open a 500,000-square-foot 3PL facility in Texas in 2028 – its fifth in the US – boosting capacity to handle products across controlled room temperature, refrigerated, frozen, ultra-low and cryogenic ranges.\n\nThe company has already tripled its ultra-low and cryogenic storage capacity across its US network to support the rising number of speciality medicines. These infrastructure investments align with projections that advanced therapy launches will accelerate in the years ahead.\n\nFrom its headquarters in Germany, NextPharma Logistics delivers integrated supply chain solutions encompassing storage, distribution, serialisation, and quality and compliance management. Its GDP-compliant facilities offer temperature-controlled storage ranging from refrigerated to deep-frozen, ensuring secure and efficient handling of sensitive pharmaceutical products.\n\n## Market access and localisation strategies\n\nStrategically distributed logistics infrastructure across Europe could prove critical for pharma companies navigating complex regulatory frameworks and reducing time-to-market for speciality products.\n\n\"Pharmaceutical companies increasingly seek partners that can provide comprehensive support across multiple markets,\" adds Alina Chesnokova, Vice President, Global 3PL Commercialisation for Cencora.\n\n![](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/668/196c01900606b051cba23103a37142c5:aa4ab25ecd27e6b05888d761bba3fd97/1731599006222.jpg)\n\nAlina Chesnokova, Vice President, Global 3PL Commercialisation for Cencora\n\n\"Through our internationally scaled 3PL service and suite of commercialisation solutions, Cencora is uniquely positioned to support their needs, delivering integrated support to enable seamless expansion into new markets and ensure products are delivered on time and in the right condition.\"\n\nThe establishment of speciality storage units featuring cryogenic technology in the Netherlands and expanded refrigerated and frozen capacity in France indicates that pharmaceutical companies are prioritising supply chain partners capable of supporting products from clinical trials through to commercialisation.\n\nThese trends underscore the growing importance of [enhanced 3PL networks](https://supplychaindigital.com/logistics/top-10-third-party-logistics-companies) to ensure compliant, efficient distribution of high-value speciality therapies – aligning with escalating ESG priorities as major players invest heavily in sustainable logistics practices.\n\n## Company portals\n\n-

26 months from groundbreaking to approval. Credit: Amgen\n\nAmgen is tackling its water use, emissions and waste through innovative design, development and manufacturing of medicines\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry faces mounting challenges from climate change, with rising temperatures threatening drug integrity during transportation, severe weather events disrupting critical infrastructure and supply chains experiencing unprecedented pressure.\n\nAmgen, a global biotechnology leader, is working to address these sustainability challenges while continuing to deliver medicines to millions of patients worldwide.\n\nIn the company's 2024 Sustainability Report, Robert Bradway, Chairman and CEO, says: \"At Amgen, our mission is to serve patients.\n\nRobert Bradway, Amgen’s Chairman and CEO. Credit: Amgen\n\n\"Every day, our talented people around the world show their dedication to our mission by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative medicines that can make a big difference against the world's most serious and prevalent diseases.\n\n\"Guided by our values, we seek to achieve responsible and sustainable growth that benefits patients, shareholders, customers, employees and suppliers.\"\n\nAmgen has been ranked 58th in [Sustainability Magazine](https://sustainabilitymag.com/)’s [Top 250 World’s Most Sustainable Companies list for 2025](https://publication.sustainabilitymag.com/gl2d).\n\n## Amgen's global operations\n\nEstablished in 1980, Amgen derives its name from Applied Molecular Genetics, its original name.\n\nThe biotechnology firm focuses on developing, manufacturing and distributing [medicines](http://sustainabilitymag.com/news/novartis-the-worlds-most-sustainable-healthcare-company) for serious illnesses.\n\nThe company operates manufacturing sites across the US, including facilities in California, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Ohio and Puerto Rico.\n\nIts international presence extends to Ireland, the Netherlands and Singapore.\n\nDuring 2024, Amgen allocated US$6bn towards research and development activities.\n\n![Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80YYmFj9qc/hqdefault.jpg)\n\n## Environmental targets and progress\n\nAmgen has set a range of environmental objectives to be achieved by 2027.\n\nThe company aims to reach carbon neutrality across Scopes 1 and 2 for its operations and owned facilities.\n\nWith 2019 as a baseline year, the firm targets a 40% reduction in water consumption and a 75% decrease in waste disposal.\n\nThese goals have received validation from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).\n\nThe company also plans to engage with 73% of its suppliers by spend in key categories to encourage their adoption of science-based targets.\n\nAccording to Amgen's 2024 Sustainability Report, the company has achieved 69% of its targeted carbon reduction, 57% of its water reduction goal and 66% of its waste disposal reduction target as of 2024.\n\nThe firm purchased renewable energy which covered 90% of electricity across its facilities.\n\nIn 2024, Amgen opened a biomanufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio, the first fully electric site in its portfolio.\n\nThe approximately 27,870 square metre facility received a US$900m expansion announcement in 2025.\n\nAmgen's biotech facility in Ohio, US uses a streamlined manufacturing and packaging process to reduce its footprint.

This suggests longer term momentum is intact even as near term sentiment cools.\n\nIf you like the structural tailwinds behind Stryker, it is worth scanning other healthcare names too. You could start with [healthcare stocks](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/7008/healthcare-sector/global?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_healthcare_screener&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4271517) as potential next candidates for your watchlist.\n\nWith revenue and earnings still growing and the share price lagging analysts’ targets, investors now face a key question: Is Stryker quietly slipping into undervalued territory, or is the market already discounting years of future growth?\n\n## Most Popular Narrative: 19.4% Undervalued\n\nWith Stryker last closing at $349.23 against a narrative fair value of $433.19, the valuation hinges on ambitious growth and margin expansion assumptions.\n\n> _Robust innovation pipeline, particularly in robotic assisted surgery (Mako platform) and next generation devices, is driving greater market share, higher average selling prices, and service revenues, which is expected to accelerate both revenue and margin expansion over time._\n\n[Read the complete narrative.](https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pt59pjl9-aging-populations-and-emerging-markets-will-transform-healthcare-nu6y?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote&utm_source=yahoo)\n\nCurious what must happen for those higher margins and earnings to materialise so quickly? The narrative leans on bold growth, richer pricing power, and a premium future earnings multiple.

Polish Radio reported last week that the U.S. wanted to send the Strykers to Poland rather than ship the vehicles back to the United States as part of a drawdown on the Continent.\n\nThe situation raised questions about whether the Army has plans to move soldiers from the Vilseck, Germany-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which uses Strykers, back to the United States.\n\n[Such a plan existed](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/major-us-military-units-to-leave-germany-as-part-of-large-drawdown-to-begin-within-weeks-esper-says-1.639217) during President Donald Trump’s first term as part of a broader reduction of the military’s mission in Germany. Those plans never came to fruition, but an ongoing force posture review by the Pentagon has raised questions about the future of the Army in Europe.\n\nBut Col. Mike Weisman, USAREUR-AF spokesman, said Monday that the “referenced activity concerns legacy equipment involved in a Foreign Military Sales process and is not related to U.S. force posture in Europe.”\n\nThe Army did not elaborate on the nature of the proposed Stryker deal. Polish media reported that the Stryker transfer being considered was to include a symbolic $1 fee.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz told Polish Radio that the technical condition of the vehicles was now being assessed to determine their usefulness to the Polish army.\n\nStrykers are eight-wheeled armored vehicles known for their versatility and range.\n\n[Army](https://www.stripes.com/t_organization/army)\n\n[Military vehicles](https://www.stripes.com/t_news/military-vehicles)\n\n[Europe](https://www.stripes.com/t_region/europe)\n\n![author picture](https://www.stripes.com/incoming/ljf02e-John-Vandiver/alternates/SQUARE_100/John%20Vandiver)\n\n[John Vandiver](https://www.stripes.com/by/John-Vandiver)\n\nJohn Vandiver\n\nJohn covers U.S. military activities across Europe and Africa.

Crotty is currently president of Stryker's instruments division. Stryker's most recent COO, Timothy Scannell, [retired in 2023](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/stryker-president-scannell-lays-out-2-year-retirement-plan-after-three-decades-company).\n\n### Related\n\n[Stryker inks $4.9B deal for blood clot buster Inari Medical](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/stryker-inks-49b-deal-blood-clot-buster-inari-medical)\n\n“Appointing Spencer President and COO strengthens our ability to sustain high growth and leverage the breadth of our portfolio,” CEO Kevin Lobo said in a [statement](https://investors.stryker.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Stryker-names-Spencer-Stiles-President-and-Chief-Operating-Officer/default.aspx). “Spencer's deep knowledge of our business and our customers, combined with his leadership and operational execution will help position us well for the future.”\n\nThe company has been on an acquisition streak for the past two years. Last January, Stryker shelled out about $4.9 billion for Inari Medical and its portfolio of clot-busting devices. The deal gave Stryker control of Inari’s hardware for treating venous thromboembolism in the arms, legs and lungs and complements its neurovascular business for attacking strokes in the brain.\n\n### Related\n\n[Olympus-backed robotics startup Swan EndoSurgical taps Stryker vet for CEO](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/olympus-backed-swan-endosurgical-names-stryker-vet-erik-todd-ceo)\n\nElsewhere in 2024, Stryker’s M&A push tallied up deals for Molli Surgical, which produces a miniature tissue marker to prep breast cancer lesions for surgery; care.ai, a developer of smart hospital systems and room management solutions; and Nico Corporation, which manufactures instruments for reaching deep strokes and surgically removing brain tumors.\n\nStryker’s march has been in lockstep with corporate strategy to trim areas of the business not in its focus. The same month the company snapped up Inari, Stryker [sold off](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/stryker-spin-spinal-implant-business-viscogliosi-brothers-owned-vb-spine) its U.S. spine implant business to Viscogliosi Brothers, which relaunched the company as VB Spine.\n\n[Stryker](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/stryker) [C-suite](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/c-suite) [COO](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/coo) [Chutes and Ladders](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/chutes-and-ladders) [mergers and acquisitions](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/mergers-and-acquisitions) [Devices](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/devices) [MedTech](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech)"

This may have investors wondering how to approach the situation.\n\nFollowing the drawdown, is now an opportune time to buy SYK? [Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members](https://stockstory.org/us/stocks/nyse/syk?utm_source=threeReasons&utm_medium=tradingview&utm_campaign=introResearchReport&partner=tradingview&utm_article=C1pxbG8FYEI%3D&utm_ticker=SYK).\n\n**Why Do Investors Watch SYK Stock?**\n\nWith over 150 million patients impacted annually through its innovative healthcare technologies, Stryker [![](https://s3-symbol-logo.tradingview.com/stryker.svg)SYK](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-SYK/) develops and manufactures advanced medical devices and equipment across orthopedics, surgical tools, neurotechnology, and patient care solutions.\n\n**Three Positive Attributes:**\n\n**1\\. Organic Growth Indicates Solid Core Business**\n\nInvestors interested in Medical Devices & Supplies - Diversified companies should track organic revenue in addition to reported revenue. This metric gives visibility into Stryker’s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement.\n\nOver the last two years, Stryker’s organic revenue averaged 10.2% year-on-year growth. This performance was solid and shows it can expand steadily without relying on expensive (and risky) acquisitions.\n\n![Stryker Organic Revenue Growth](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/stockstory:fdd08e266094b-5d03b871697e2f9e40843c7e7e78c680-resized.webp)\n\n**2\\. Economies of Scale Give It Negotiating Leverage with Suppliers**\n\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\n\nWith $24.38 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Stryker sports economies of scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n\n**3\\. Outstanding Long-Term EPS Growth**\n\nAnalyzing the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable – for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nStryker’s spectacular 13.1% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. This tells us it maintained its per-share profitability as it expanded.\n\n![Stryker Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/stockstory:fdd08e266094b-fc81864e78f11c8055b83fa4c8ca0074-resized.webp)\n\n**Final Judgment**\n\nStryker possesses several positive attributes. With the recent decline, the stock trades at 24.4× forward P/E (or $350.50 per share). Is now a good time to buy?

( [NYSE:ALV](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALV)) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the [Simply Wall St analysis model](https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf).\n\n[We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global?blueprint=4249652&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=investing-ideas&utm_source=yahoo&utm_content=dividend-forecast-yield-6pcnt)\n\n## Crunching The Numbers\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n#### 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** | **2031** | **2032** | **2033** | **2034** | **2035** |\n| **Levered FCF ($, Millions)** | US$723.3m | US$773.7m | US$734.0m | US$716.3m | US$711.2m | US$714.7m | US$724.1m | US$737.8m | US$754.8m | US$774.4m |\n| **Growth Rate Estimate Source** | Analyst x13 | Analyst x9 | Analyst x1 | Est @ -2.41% | Est @ -0.71% | Est @ 0.48% | Est @ 1.32% | Est @ 1.90% | Est @ 2.31% | Est @ 2.59% |\n| **Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4%** | US$667 | US$659 | US$577 | US$520 | US$476 | US$441 | US$413 | US$388 | US$366 | US$347 |\n\n_(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)_\n\n**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = US$4.9b\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.4%.\n\n**Terminal Value (TV)** = FCF2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$774m× (1 + 3.3%) ÷ (8.4%– 3.3%) = US$16b\n\n**Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)** = TV / (1 + r)10= US$16b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$7.0b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$12b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$118, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\n[![dcf](<Base64-Image-Removed>)](https://simplywall.st/company/id/3A0B6FB9-FBB9-48F5-926E-65201F84F4CC/valuation?blueprint=4249652&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo)\n\nNYSE:ALV Discounted Cash Flow November 30th 2025\n\n## The Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Autoliv as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.211. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\n[See our latest analysis for Autoliv](https://simplywall.st/company/id/3A0B6FB9-FBB9-48F5-926E-65201F84F4CC?blueprint=4249652&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n### SWOT Analysis for Autoliv\n\n**Strength**\n\n- Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\n\n- Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\n\n- Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\n\n**Weakness**\n\n- Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.\n\n\n- Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Auto Components market.\n\n\n**Opportunity**\n\n- Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\n\n- Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\n\n**Threat**\n\n- Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\n\n## Looking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Autoliv, we've put together three important items you should consider:\n\n1. **Risks**: For instance, we've identified [**2 warning signs for Autoliv**](https://simplywall.st/company/id/3A0B6FB9-FBB9-48F5-926E-65201F84F4CC?blueprint=4249652&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion&utm_source=yahoo) that you should be aware of.\n\n2. **Future Earnings**: How does ALV's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

It then built an interface system on top of this which was able to run simulations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutlining the motivating factors driving these decisions, Dr Linge commented: \"In a time where there is a lot of disruption and uncertainty, we need to create visibility for our colleagues in an easy and fast way, enabling decision-making across our functional siloes to some degree.\"\n\n### Effective execution\n\nDr Linge shared her view that collaboration across functions was instrumental to Autoliv achieving its goals of increased visibility and data-informed decision-making.\n\nShe outlined three key factors in ensuring the smoothness of this project's execution: a company culture that encourages cross-functional collaboration; a compelling reason for individuals to get involved in the project in order to benefit from it; the involvement of IT professionals from the very start of the project.\n\n[![](https://image.automotivelogistics.media/2340851.webp?imageId=2340851&x=0.00&y=11.48&cropw=100.00&croph=82.49&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=528&format=jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Watch: ALSC Digital Strategies Europe 2025 Day 2 Wrap up**\\\\\n\\\\\nChristopher Ludwig, chief content officer at Automotive Logistics & Ultima Media provides a summary of ALSC Digital Strategies Europe Day 2.](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/video/watch-alsc-ds-europe-2025-day-2-wrap-up/2340659)\n\n### Ensuring data quality\n\nWith data at the heart of this strategy, data quality is crucial to its success. \"The engine of this whole command centre and digital twin is the end-to-end data model,\" Dr Linge elaborated.\n\nShe said \"processes, people and systems\" were the three main considerations for Autoliv. She explained that most of the time, it's not the data that is poor, it's that processes in place aren't collecting the right data.\n\nBoth audits and a ticketing system ensure that data quality can be regularly monitored and consistency improved. \"You get better data the more you use it,\" she said, noting that data will never be perfect but identifying flaws and gaps in data is an important – albeit \"never-ending\" – process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Results of the project\n\n[![](https://image.automotivelogistics.media/1982371.webp?imageId=1982371&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=644&format=jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Register now – The story of 2025: Key events, impacts and lessons of disruption**\\\\\n\\\\\nJoin Automotive Logistics’ December livestream to reflect on a defining year for the global automotive logistics and supply chain community.](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/livestreams/register-now-the-story-of-2025-key-events-impacts-and-lessons-of-disruption/215818)\n\nThe potential applications of the command centre are virtually limitless, according Dr Linge. She explained that in its prototype stage, it was used to estimate the impact of US tariffs and global countermeasures, with this information helping Autoliv's colleagues in the US and Mexico to understand where to focus their attention in terms of risk mitigation.\n\nIt can also be used to address supply shortages, allowing for increased visibility of stock across an entire supplier base and scenario-based simulations to predict when inventory will be depleted.\n\n### Improvements going forward\n\nLooking ahead, Dr Linge identified that there are various ways in which the command centre can be improved, beginning with enhancing it with even more data from a wider range of functions – emissions data from sustainability leads to get a better grip on greenhouse gas accounting, for example.\n\nThere are other ways to improve too, such as the addition of a chatbot, which Autoliv is currently testing. \"We have endless opportunities here, and we cannot endlessly programme dashboards,\" she said. \"But by asking the chatbot, you can get tailored analysis.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[alsc digital strategies europe highlights](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/alsc%20digital%20strategies%20europe%20highlights) [video](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/video) [data](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/data) [digitalisation](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/digitalisation) [gisela linge](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/gisela%20linge) [interviews](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/interviews) [red sofa interviews](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/red%20sofa%20interviews) [supply chain](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/supply%20chain) [supply chain planning](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/supply%20chain%20planning) [tier suppliers](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/tier%20suppliers) [autoliv](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/tag/autoliv)\n\nAutomotive Logistics Media Pack 2024\n\n**Sign up to the Automotive Logistics newsletter**\n\nDelivered every Tuesday.

Tyson said it had no intention of curtailing existing contract growing but would not offer new grower contracts in the watershed because it is “no longer a hospitable place to do business” under the current legal climate.\n\nTyson said it would continue to honor all existing grower contracts through their full terms, some of which extend more than a decade, but warned that continued litigation left the company with “no choice” but to reduce future business activity in the area. The company characterized the lawsuit as misguided and said policymakers in Arkansas and Oklahoma were seeking a more balanced solution that preserves both environmental progress and agricultural production.\n\n\\- Advertisement -\n\nThe response followed [remarks by Drummond,](https://meatingplace.com/ag-says-tyson-using-farmers-as-pawns-in-pollution-fight/) who accused Tyson of running a “coordinated misinformation campaign” to intimidate Oklahomans as the state pursues remedies for phosphorus pollution in the Illinois River watershed. The lawsuit, first filed in 2005, targets major poultry companies over allegations that land application of chicken litter polluted waterways. In 2023, U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzell ruled in favor of the state and ordered negotiations on remedies after reaffirming that the watershed remains impaired.\n\nDrummond rejected claims that the case targets farmers, noting that no individual growers are defendants. He also pointed to reports that Tyson is pursuing additional processing capacity in the region, arguing those efforts undercut claims that the litigation is forcing the company to withdraw.\n\nTyson said it remained willing to pursue an amicable resolution and said it would welcome a path forward that allows poultry operations to continue in northwest Arkansas and northeast Oklahoma.\n\n#### Comments (0)\n\nOnly Meatingplace members may read or post comments.\n\n[Learn More and Sign Up](https://meatingplace.com/membership/?pk=MTGWC)\n\nAlready a member?

That said, there are resources available for farmers looking at moving part of their production to direct-to-consumer efforts, plus a large variety of resources for workers affected by the plant closing. Curt Arens\n\n[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.farmprogress.com/farm-business/practical-resources-for-nebraska-town-rocked-by-beef-plant-closing)[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.farmprogress.com/farm-business/practical-resources-for-nebraska-town-rocked-by-beef-plant-closing)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.farmprogress.com/farm-business/practical-resources-for-nebraska-town-rocked-by-beef-plant-closing&title=Practical%20resources%20for%20Nebraska%20town%20rocked%20by%20beef%20plant%20closing)\n\nIt is a devastating loss. For Lexington, Neb., a town with a population of about 11,000, losing the Tyson Foods beef processing plant in January that employs around 3,200 workers is a deadly blow. For farmers, losing a marketing avenue and beef slaughter capacity causes real angst.\n\nThe closure, set to take place Jan. 20, affects local farmers and ranchers who were selling to the plant, which has a slaughter capacity at about 5,000 head per day. It impacts workers losing their jobs, and their families.\n\nIt impacts the economy, the culture and the infrastructure that Lexington has built over the years the plant has existed there. Everything is turned upside down.\n\nThat’s why on Nov. 29, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced an important collaboration between multiple agencies and community organizations to assist Lexington families impacted by the closure.\n\nThis rapid response team includes Nebraska departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Economic Development, and Agriculture. A special event was held Dec. 3-4 at the Dawson County Fairgrounds for Tyson workers, with agencies covering such topics as unemployment insurance benefits, job search resources and other financial support programs.\n\nIn his statement, Pillen said, “The whole state is behind the community of Lexington as they face this tough transition. Our state agencies are working together to provide the support this community deserves.”\n\nRelated: [How will the Tyson beef plant restructuring affect cattle producers?](https://www.farmprogress.com/livestock/how-will-the-tyson-beef-plant-restructuring-affect-cattle-producers-)\n\n“This is a difficult time for the community and the impacted workers, but they have truly come together to help make DOL’s efforts possible. An event of this size would not be happening this quickly without community support,” said Katie Thurber, commissioner of labor, in a news release. “Nebraska employers are also coming together for job fairs, with more details to be announced soon.”\n\nIn addition to efforts by state agencies, [the Lexington Community Foundation](https://governor.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/doc/press/Assistance%20in%20Area%20Flyer.pdf)has information about local organizations that are providing and accepting assistance to support workers.\n\n“On the broader impacts for beef producers, the closure removes a major regional processing outlet and will have ripple effects across the supply chain,” said Bobbi Howard, farm and community director at the Center for Rural Affairs, based in Lyons, Neb. “The loss of jobs at the plant will have significant economic and community-level consequences, but for producers, the immediate impacts include delays, fewer marketing options and longer hauling distances, particularly for those who relied on this plant for consistent throughput.”\n\nRelated: [How to unlock cover crop benefits for healthy soil, and profits](https://www.farmprogress.com/conservation-and-sustainability/how-to-unlock-cover-crop-benefits-for-healthy-soil-and-profits)\n\n## Impacts and resources for farmers\n\nIn the long term, closure of the Tyson plant, even as slaughter capacity is picked up in other facilities, reduces Nebraska’s total cattle harvest capacity by about 15%, Howard said.\n\nWhile Sustainable Beef in North Platte helps to improve the slaughter capacity landscape, it is a smaller plant ramping up to slaughter about 1,500 head per day, much less than the Tyson facility.\n\n“Disruptions at this scale often increase interest in local or direct-to-consumer marketing,” Howard said. “That can create opportunities for some producers, but it’s not a simple pivot. Processing appointments, transportation and consistent sales channels remain ongoing restraints without additional support.”\n\nFarmers exploring direct-to-consumer marketing or diversifying outlets can connect with resources with help from the Center for Rural Affairs, Howard added. There is technical assistance available, along with business planning support and partners who specialize in local and regional meat supply chains.\n\nHoward offered resources available to producers, including the following:\n\n[MarketMaker Nebraska’s buy/sell page.](https://ne.foodmarketmaker.com/buysell?qb=e30&c=null) This page lists local market resources, such as for farmers markets and farm-to-school sales, and hosts the MarketMaker database of markets.\n\n[Nebraska Business Development Center](https://ncdc.unl.edu/)[.](https://ncdc.unl.edu/) Hosted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, this is Nebraska’s resource for cooperative-based business development, helping with education, training and technical assistance to groups working together to meet their goals.\n\n[Buy Fresh, Buy Local Nebraska](https://buylocalnebraska.org/resources/selling-local-food-products/)[.](https://buylocalnebraska.org/resources/selling-local-food-products/) This is an information resource and marketing avenue for locally grown crops and livestock or meat products in Nebraska.\n\n[Nebraska Department of Agriculture Ag Promotion and Development Division](https://nda.nebraska.gov/promotion)[.](https://nda.nebraska.gov/promotion) This resource offers information and marketing support for Nebraska’s ag products.\n\n[Center for Rural Affairs](https://www.cfra.org/)[.](https://www.cfra.org/)CFRA offers producer cohorts focusing on selling to local institutions, along with other business development topics. The organization also can assist with capital access for those seeking a business loan by contacting [loans@cfra.org](mailto:loans@cfra.org).\n\n[National Center for Appropriate Technology](https://attra.ncat.org/). ATTRA is a program that provides advisers and a wide array of publications on direct marketing of crops and livestock.\n\n## Resources for Tyson workers\n\nPreviously, Howard worked as an administrator for the Nebraska Department of Labor, where she oversaw all the field offices and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act programs.\n\nShe said NDOL can help displaced workers with unemployment insurance, job searches, resume preparation, connections to local employers and access to the federal dislocated worker funds that can help get individuals back to work more quickly, covering training costs if needed and providing supportive services and short-term financial assistance.\n\nHoward said resources that can help workers affected by the Tyson plant closure include the following from NDOL:\n\n- NDOL Greater Nebraska, [ndol.greaternebraska@nebraska.gov](mailto:ndol.greaternebraska@nebraska.gov)\n\n- NDOL Rapid Response, [ndol.rapidresponse@nebraska.gov](mailto:ndol.rapidresponse@nebraska.gov)\n\n- NDOL Lexington office, [ndol.lexingtonwfd@nebraska.gov](mailto:ndol.lexingtonwfd@nebraska.gov)\n\n\n## Community support services\n\nWhile there are many community and faith-based resources in the area to help displaced workers and others impacted by the Tyson closure, Howard suggested a couple of familiar resources:\n\nLutheran Family Services. They can assist workers in navigating local resources for food, housing and mental health.

Before joining Farm Progress first as a field editor in 2010, and then as editor of [Nebraska Farmer](https://www.farmprogress.com/nebraska-farmer) in 2021, he had worked as a freelance farm writer for 27 years for newspapers and farm magazines, including Nebraska Farmer. His real full-time career during this period was farming his family’s fourth-generation land near Crofton, Neb., where his family raised corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, alfalfa, cattle, hogs and Christmas trees.\n\nCurt and his wife, Donna, have four children: Lauren, Taylor, Zachary and Benjamin. They are active in their church and St. Rose School in Crofton, where Donna teaches. The family now rents out their crop ground to a neighbor, but still lives on the same farm first operated by Curt's great-grandparents. The family runs a few cows and other assorted 4-H and FFA critters.\n\nPreviously, the 1986 University of Nebraska animal science graduate wrote a weekly rural life column, developed a farm radio program and wrote books about farm life. He received media honors from the Nebraska Forest Service, Center for Rural Affairs, Nebraska Association of County Extension Boards and Nebraska Association of Natural Resources Districts.\n\nHe wrote about the spiritual side of farming in his 2008 book, [Down to Earth: Celebrating a Blessed Life on the Land](https://www.amazon.com/Down-Earth-Celebrating-Blessed-Life/dp/0879463473), garnering a Catholic Press Association award.\n\n[See more from Curt Arens](https://www.farmprogress.com/author/curt-arens)\n\nSubscribe to receive top agriculture news\n\nBe informed daily with these free

Some have slowly [started to rebuild](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-cattle-ranchers-slowly-start-rebuild-decimated-herd-2025-08-07/) their herds, though it takes at least two years to raise full-grown cattle.\n\nTyson's beef business suffered adjusted losses of $426 million in the 12 months ended on September 27 and $291 million over the previous year. The meatpacker projected the unit will lose $400 million to $600 million in the 2026 fiscal year.\n\n\"We all expected a plant to be closed at some point in 2026,\" said Rich Nelson, chief strategist for Allendale. \"I'm a little surprised they're doing it preemptively.\"\n\nLosses in Tyson's beef business were a turnaround from the fat profits it and other processors reaped during the COVID-19 pandemic, when meat prices soared as infections among plant workers slowed output.\n\n## CLOSURE THREATENS LOCAL ECONOMY\n\nThe Lexington plant can process roughly 5,000 cattle per day, or about 5% of total U.S. slaughtering, but it has already been operating below capacity, said Matt Wiegand, commodity broker for FuturesOne in Nebraska. Its closure will shock the city of about 10,000 residents and hurt local feedyards that fatten cattle, he said.\n\n\"Tyson's announcement will have a devastating impact,\" said U.S. Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska. \"It's no secret that just a few years ago, packers like Tyson were making windfall profits while the rest of the industry was continuously in the red.\"\n\nIn Amarillo, Tyson's plant can slaughter roughly 6,000 cattle per day, according to industry estimates.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment.\n\nTrump has sought to [boost beef imports](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-quadrupling-argentina-beef-tariff-rate-quota-80000-metric-tons-2025-10-23/) from countries such as Argentina to ease prices for U.S. consumers, angering American ranchers. On Thursday, he [removed 40% tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-order-remove-tariffs-some-brazilian-agricultural-imports-2025-11-20/) he had imposed this summer on Brazilian food products that slowed imports of beef used to make hamburger meat.\n\nTrump has also [accused meatpacking companies](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-asked-doj-investigate-meat-packing-companies-driving-up-beef-2025-11-07/) of driving up U.S. beef prices through manipulation and collusion, and ordered the Justice Department to investigate.\n\nReporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Nia Williams and Bill Berkrot\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nShare\n\n- X\n\n- Facebook\n\n- Linkedin\n\n- Email\n\n- Link\n\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[![Tom Polansek](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Farc-authors%2Freuters%2F32af11b1-2356-4032-9932-446198361081.png?auth=4d0bb2284feaa65e12a799edde3c42bb9bbdc594f2259c0ed63876ef7e743923&height=120&width=120&quality=80&smart=true)](https://www.reuters.com/authors/tom-polansek/)\n\n[Tom Polansek](https://www.reuters.com/authors/tom-polansek/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nTom has been a journalist for Reuters in Chicago since 2011.

Google maps\n\nWhen she went to chow down on her order, Bernhardt allegedly “bit into a rodent contained within the meal she was consuming,” the lawsuit filed on Monday in New York County Supreme Court said.\n\n“\\[T\\]he rodent was within the plaintiff’s mouth after biting into the meal,” the complaint added.\n\nThe gnarly incident caused Bernhardt to “suffer severe bodily injuries,” pain, shock, and mental anguish, court documents alleged.\n\nThe popular fast food chain “knew or should have known that its product was dangerous to member(s) of the general public,” the lawsuit argued.\n\n![Employee prepares a Chipotle burrito bowl.](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/employee-prepares-burrito-bowl-chipotle-117057297.jpg?w=1024)The gnarly incident caused Bernhardt to “suffer severe bodily injuries,” pain, shock, and mental anguish, court documents alleged. Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nChipotle strongly denied the allegations in the suit and “will vigorously defend ourselves against these claims,” a company spokesperson told The Post.\n\n“Internal agents of Chipotle analyzed the evidence both in person and in photographs and are confident the object is a chicken tendon/ligament,” Laurie Schalow, Chief Corporate Affairs and Food Safety Officer, said in a statement.\n\n“The health and safety of our employees and guests is our highest priority, and we have industry-leading food safety practices in place across our restaurants,” Schalow added.\n\nDoorDash and an unnamed deliveryman were also named as co-defendants — with the lawsuit arguing the deliveryman employed through the popular app “improperly and negligently delivered the product in an unsafe and unsanitary manner.”\n\nThe exact injuries Bernhardt suffered after biting into the rogue rodent, or the type of rodent allegedly in the meal, is not immediately clear.\n\n117\n\nWhat do you think? [Post a comment.](https://nypost.com/2025/12/09/us-news/customer-allegedly-bit-into-a-rodent-in-burrito-bowl-from-nyc-chipotle-lawsuit/#spotim-specific)\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a money judgment and undefined compensatory and punitive damages for the unlucky customer.\n\nDoorDash and Bernhardt’s attorney, Steven Vaccaro, did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment."

On December 2, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) announced that it will release its fiscal Q4 2025 results on February 3. The stock has plunged more than 14.5% since its last earnings release.\n\n​Regardless, Wall Street maintains a positive outlook on the stock. Analysts 12-month price target reflects more than 31.4% upside from the current level, driven by a brighter outlook for consumer stocks. On December 3, Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard released a research note highlighting that while Consumer stocks have underperformed the broader market, the forward earnings valuation looks attractive. The firm believes that further volatility in the tech sector can lead investors to find a safe haven in the Consumer Staples sector, and companies with international exposure within the sector are expected to benefit the most.\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n​Earlier on November 21, Bernstein SocGen Group reiterated a Buy rating on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) with a $40 price target. The firm highlighted that they reassessed their total addressable market analysis and found that the company’s store potential remains intact. Bernstein added that the recent challenges that have led the stock performance down are more cyclical rather than structural. The firm believes that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)  has untapped levers, which will help the company grow traffic.\n\n​Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) owns and operates a chain of fast-casual restaurants specializing in customizable Mexican-inspired dishes like burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, quesadillas, and salads made with fresh ingredients.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CMG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(Image via Cullinan Properties )\n\nJOLIET, IL — Cullinan Properties issued a press release announcing on Tuesday morning that Chipotle Mexican Grill will celebrate the grand opening of its newest Joliet location at Rock Run Collection on Wednesday, December 10. A ribbon cutting will take place at 10:15 a.m., with the restaurant opening to the public at 10:30 a.m. at 1351 Shale Road, Joliet.\n\nThe new Chipotle features a modern restaurant design and a convenient Chipotlane drive-thru pick up lane for digital orders. The location is expected to bring approximately 30 new jobs to the Joliet area, offering competitive pay and benefits. Chipotle, a multinational fast-casual restaurant brand, is known for its made-to-order bowls, burritos, and tacos prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients.\n\nChipotle joins the already-open Hollywood Casino Joliet, which has exceeded opening projections, and The View at Rock Run Collection, upscale apartments currently leasing. The new restaurant will serve the growing number of current and future residents and visitors who will live, stay, dine, shop, and play at this super-regional destination. Future neighbors will include Drury Hotel, Chick-fil-A, Ricky Rockets, and many more to come.\n\n## Find out what's happening in Jolietfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n\nSubscribe\n\n“Chipotle is a powerful addition to Rock Run Collection and another strong step forward as the site continues to gain momentum,” said Diane Cullinan Oberhelman, Chairman of Cullinan Properties. “With Hollywood Casino now open, residential leasing underway, and more dining, hospitality, and retail on the horizon, this opening reflects the real, visible progress happening across the property.

The store worker offered to help, but once he popped open the hood, things went sideways.\n\n\"He’s trying to get his hand down there,\" Mardrigal explains. She says with Jeeps, it can go one of two ways: stick your hand in, pop out the old headlight, and put in a new one.\n\n\"Like a normal car,\" she adds.\n\n\"Or it can be like my year,\" she says, \"where you can’t easily get to the headlight. You can’t get to it. You can’t get your arm down there.\"\n\nThe Advanced Auto Parts workers told her she would need a mechanic because most of the front end has to be removed to swap a headlight.\n\n\"Why are we making things so difficult for something basic?\" Mardrigal says. She adds that she’s not taking her Jeep to a dealership because of the cost, and now has to find a mechanic to do the job.\n\n\"Why? Why is a basic thing like changing your headlight something I have to take to a mechanic to do?\" she asks.\n\nMardrigal is frustrated.\n\n\"For the amount of money we pay for these cars, changing the headlights should be an easy task,\" she says. \"If you’re looking at buying a Jeep, this is something to think about.\"\n\n\"Count your days,\" she tells Jeep in her TikTok about the experience. \"Count your days.\"\n\n## Why Is Changing Headlights On Certain Vehicles So Hard?\n\nChanging the headlights on a Jeep Cherokee, especially Grand Cherokee models, is [notoriously tricky](https://www.jeepgarage.org/threads/passenger-headlight-bulb-removal.224115/). The problem isn’t just the bulb itself—it’s the way they’re designed.\n\nTight, awkward spaces and blocked access points often mean you [have to remove](https://www.facebook.com/groups/278909955484569/posts/24231104969838399/) other parts, like the airbox on the driver’s side or the ECU and coolant reservoir on the passenger side, to reach the headlight. On some LED models, you may even need to remove the entire front bumper to swap the assembly.\n\nBlocked access points make what seems simple a cumbersome task. Braces or tiny openings can [make it challenging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7T1M9Yx0yQ&t=489s) to fit an adult’s hand inside. Bulbs or their plastic covers can get stuck, requiring tools or extra force to remove. Even once you get the components out, the angles to twist and remove the bulbs are difficult, which can lead to scraped knuckles or broken clips.\n\nThere are a few ways to make it less painful. On the driver’s side, removing the air filter housing [gives better access](https://www.facebook.com/groups/278909955484569/posts/5407135635995283/). On the passenger side, relocating the coolant reservoir [can also help](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandCherokee/comments/xlzyp3/2018_jeep_grand_cherokee_overland_headlight/). Patience is key—you wouldn’t want to break anything in the process.\n\nIf you find yourself getting frustrated with the task, you may want to seek professional help. Some shops will install the headlights for free if you buy parts from them, or you can pay for labor. With Jeeps, what looks like a simple task can turn into a project, and knowing the obstacles ahead is half the battle.\n\n## The Problem Isn’t Just Jeeps\n\nViewers who saw Mardrigal’s video quickly pointed out that Jeep isn’t the only brand that has made changing headlights a headache.\n\n\"Well, most today you have to change the whole headlight assembly,\" one said. \"I did one that was $1,200 apiece \\[and\\] I charged $350 \\[for\\] labor.\"\n\n\"Been like this for at least 15 years. Wait until you have a vehicle with LED headlamps. Have to replace the entire assembly. Can’t blame manufacturers really,\" a second remarked.\n\n\"That’s normal for a Jeep Grand Cherokee, not Jeep’s fault,\" another explained.\n\nSeveral commenters suggested this is part of a broader trend: Newer cars are harder to work on overall.\n\n\"People wanted all the extra stuff in cars; they had to make room for it,\" one said. \"Everything is hard to get to now.\"\n\nVia email, Madrigal told _Motor1_ that she resolved the headlight issue thanks to the staff at Advance Auto Parts.\n\n\"I ended up getting my headlights fixed due to the amazing staff at Advanced Auto, whom did it for free!\" she said. Madrigal said that the staffer had seen this issue previously and knew how to access the headlights from under the wheel well without removing the front end.\n\n\"But if I hadn't been so lucky with Advance Auto, I would have had to go to a mechanic and after calling around and getting estimates it would have cost me between $120-$400 depending on the shops hourly rate with labor and how long the job would take plus the cost of the headlights themselves,\" she continued. \"After knowing how increasingly difficult it is to do a simple task like changing my headlights on my Jeep Grand Cherokee it definitely is something that dissuades me from from buying a Jeep again and definitely something I would tell people that are thinking about buying Jeep to keep in mind.\"\n\n_Motor1_ has reached out to Stellantis, which owns Jeep, via email. We’ll update this if it responds.\n\n> TikTok Embed\n>\n>

I actually suspect investors are punishing the stock more for what its rival **, AutoZone**( [AZO](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/azo/) 2.16%), said this morning.\n\n![1 dotted red arrow glowing and going down.](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F846241%2F1-dotted-red-arrow-glowing-and-going-down.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n## AutoZone earnings are Advance Auto's problem\n\nReporting earnings for its fiscal Q1 2026 today, AutoZone said its quarterly sales were up 8% year over year at $4.6 billion, and [same-store sales](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/same-store-sales/) grew 5.5%.\n\nNeither number was \"bad,\" exactly. But AutoZone nonetheless fell short of analyst forecasts for Q1 sales and earnings, both. Earnings per share of $31.04 looked particularly bad in light of forecasts for $32.40, hurt by a big two percentage-point decline in [gross margin](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/gross-margin/), and operating costs that increased as a percentage of sales.\n\nOn the bottom line, that worked out to a 5% drop in AutoZone's earnings per share.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## What does this mean for Advance Auto Parts stock?\n\nAutoZone and Advance Auto Parts both compete in the [automotive parts market](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/auto-parts-stocks/) (obviously). Investors seem to be thinking that if business isn't great for AutoZone, a strong and profitable performer in this market, it's probably even worse for Advance Auto Parts -- a much weaker performer, and unprofitable in three of its last six reported quarters.\n\nTo me, this seems a more likely reason -- and a _better_ reason -- for Advance Auto Parts to be selling off today than the mere fact of a random analyst tweaking its Advance Auto price target $2 lower.\n\nIt's also a better reason for _you_ to [consider selling](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/when-to-sell-stocks/) Advance Auto Parts stock.\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Rich Smith](https://g.foolcdn.com/avatar/15230197/large.ashx?_w=3840)\n\nRich Smith is a contributing Motley Fool defense and stock market analyst covering publicly traded and emerging companies in defense, space, aerospace, and other sectors.

With the stock holding steady near $87, investors are weighing the current value in relation to the company’s recent financial results and longer-term performance.\n\n[See our latest analysis for Science Applications International.](https://www.simplywall.st/company/id/2008d3f2-02a1-4f25-95df-501492c31754?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_company_latest_analysis&utm_source=yahoo)\n\nSAIC’s share price has slipped 12.4% in the past month and remains down more than 22% year-to-date, with the 1-year total shareholder return of -28.2% highlighting a tough period for investors. Recent price losses suggest momentum has faded as the market reassesses both risk and growth prospects against a mixed backdrop of financial results.\n\nIf you’re looking for your next idea beyond SAIC, now is the perfect moment to broaden your search and discover [fast growing stocks with high insider ownership](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4222585)\n\nWith shares trading well below recent analyst price targets and a challenging track record over the past year, the key question now is whether SAIC represents an undervalued opportunity or if the market has accurately priced in future growth.\n\n## Most Popular Narrative: 24.9% Undervalued\n\nWith the fair value set at $116 and shares recently closing at $87.15, the popular narrative suggests notable upside if these projections hold. This creates a striking gap between market price and where analysts see the stock heading.\n\n> _The company's strategic focus on differentiated, high-growth capabilities in areas such as mission integration, digital transformation, and advanced IT modernization positions SAIC to benefit from the government's ongoing push to update legacy systems. This may accelerate top-line growth as procurement normalizes. A robust pipeline and strong book-to-bill ratios, along with sustained win rates in recompetes and pending award backlogs, provide significant building blocks for revenue recovery and long-term expansion once current government funding delays and efficiency initiatives subside._\n\n[Read the complete narrative.](https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/0ivikfqs-digital-transformation-will-reshape-government-it-amid-pricing-risks-jl7l?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote&utm_source=yahoo)\n\nCurious what numbers support that fair value?

It would tap into what are known as the confidential computing capabilities of its graphics processing units (GPUs), the sources said.\n\nGet a daily digest of breaking business news straight to your inbox with the Reuters Business newsletter. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/newsletters/business/?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Fnvidia-builds-location-verification-tech-that-could-help-fight-chip-smuggling-2025-12-10%2F)\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe software was built to allow customers to track a chip's overall computing performance - a common practice among companies that buy fleets of processors for large data centers - and would use the time delay in communicating with servers run by Nvidia to give a sense of the chip's location on par with what other internet-based services can provide, according to an Nvidia official.\n\n\"We're in the process of implementing a new software service that empowers data center operators to monitor the health and inventory of their entire AI GPU fleet,\" Nvidia said in a statement. \"This customer-installed software agent leverages GPU telemetry to monitor fleet health, integrity and inventory.\"\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nNvidia on Wednesday also said there are \"no features that allow Nvidia to remotely control or take action on registered systems\" and that the telemetry data sent to Nvidia servers is \"read only,\" meaning that the company's servers cannot write data back to the chip.\n\n\"There is no feature within Nvidia GPUs that allow Nvidia or a remote actor to disable the Nvidia GPU,\" Nvidia said. \"There is no kill switch.\"\n\nThe feature will first be made available on Nvidia's latest \"Blackwell\" chips, which have more security features for a process called \"attestation\" than Nvidia's previous generations of Hopper and Ampere semiconductors, but Nvidia is examining options for those prior generations, according to the Nvidia official.\n\nIf released, Nvidia's location update could address calls [from the White House](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-administration-recommends-location-verification-ai-chips-2025-07-24/) and [lawmakers](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-address-ai-chip-smuggling-2025-05-15/) from both major political parties in the U.S. Congress for measures to prevent smuggling AI chips to China and other countries where their sale is restricted. Those calls have intensified as the Department of Justice has [brought criminal cases](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/alleged-ai-chip-smuggling-china-leads-us-calls-chip-tracking-2025-11-20/) [against China-connected smuggling rings](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-justice-department-accuses-two-chinese-men-trying-smuggle-nvidia-chips-2025-12-09/) that were allegedly attempting to bring more than $160 million worth of Nvidia chips to China.\n\nBut the calls for location verification in the U.S. have also led China's top cybersecurity regulator to call Nvidia in for questioning about whether its products contain backdoors that would allow the U.S. to bypass its chips' security features.\n\nThat regulatory cloud came to the fore again this week, after U.S. President Donald Trump [said he would allow exports of the Nvidia H200](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-open-up-exports-nvidia-h200-chips-china-semafor-reports-2025-12-08/), the most immediate predecessor to its current flagship Blackwell chips, to China. Foreign policy experts expressed skepticism about whether China would allow companies there to purchase them.\n\nNvidia has [strongly denied that its chips have backdoors](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-says-its-chips-have-no-backdoors-after-china-flags-h20-security-concerns-2025-07-31/). Software experts have said that it [would be possible for Nvidia to build chip location verification](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-lawmaker-targets-nvidia-chip-smuggling-china-with-new-bill-2025-05-05/) without compromising the security of its offerings.\n\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Michael Martina in Washington; Editing by Thomas Derpinghaus\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nShare\n\n- X\n\n- Facebook\n\n- Linkedin\n\n- Email\n\n- Link\n\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[![Michael Martina](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fauthor-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub%2Freuters%2F653fd6ea-eb66-4479-9b05-78012b3dd33a.jpg?auth=d385bfb9f0b5020d9952af0f6adee05b93eed5e2a87a56dd87d74d76b1071ebf&height=120&width=120&quality=80&smart=true)](https://www.reuters.com/authors/michael-martina/)\n\n[Michael Martina](https://www.reuters.com/authors/michael-martina/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nMichael Martina is a Washington-based foreign policy correspondent who covers U.S.-China relations and the global impact of the two countries' diplomatic, technology, and military competition.

The dot-plot chart will receive heightened attention. JP Morgan experienced its most significant one-day decline in six months after warning on higher 2026 spending amid rising credit card competition and AI-related costs. Oracle will provide the next AI test, as high debt and valuation concerns linger, while silver rallied to a fresh all-time high above $60, driven by tight supply and economic woes.\n\n## M&T Bank Fundamental Analysis\n\nM&T Bank is a regional bank holding company founded in 1856 with over 950 branches spanning twelve states.\n\nSo, why am I bearish on MTB after its recent pullback?\n\nI remain bearish due to its declining operating and profit margins, the likelihood of lower interest rates, which will further pressure margins, and its slowing revenue growth. The worsening debt-to-asset ratio is equally concerning, and M&T Bank accepts lower yields to defend its market position. The 5-year PEG ratio confirms that MTB remains excessively overvalued, facing a struggling consumer, and decreased profit potential.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Metric | Value | Verdict |\n| P/E Ratio | 12.20 | Bullish |\n| P/B Ratio | 1.15 | Bullish |\n| PEG Ratio | 6.17 | Bearish |\n| Current Ratio | Unavailable | Bearish |\n| ROIC-WACC Ratio | Negative | Bearish |\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.20 makes MTB an inexpensive stock. By comparison, the P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 29.21.\n\nThe average analyst price target for MTB is $218.88. It suggests moderate upside potential with rising downside risks.\n\n## M&T Bank Technical Analysis\n\nToday’s MTB Signal\n\n![M&T Bank Price Chart](https://www.dailyforex.com/files/mtb_image_10122025.webp)\n\n- The MTB D1 chart shows price action approaching a horizontal resistance zone.\n- It also shows price action between its ascending 0.0% and 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement Fan levels.\n- The Bull Bear Power Indicator is bullish with a negative divergence.\n- Bullish trading volumes have faded during the recent advance and do not support the rally.\n- MTB advanced with the S&P 500, a bullish confirmation, but bearish catalysts have risen.\n\n## My Call on M&T Bank\n\nI am taking a short position in MTB between $197.12 and $203.96. I am cashing out due to declining margins and rising margin pressures, a high 5-year PEG ratio, and MTB’s quantity-over-quality approach.\n\n- MTB Entry Level: Between $197.12 and $203.96\n- MTB Take Profit: Between $168.09 and $174.76\n- MTB Stop Loss: Between $210.45 and $218.88\n- Risk/Reward Ratio: 2.18\n\nReady to trade our analysis of M&T Bank?

This adjustment may influence interest rates on various loans and credit products offered by the bank.\n\nM&T Bank Corp, a regional bank headquartered in Buffalo, New York, manages approximately $210 billion in assets as of June 30, 2025. The bank's operations are concentrated in New England and the US Mid-Atlantic, with a strong emphasis on community banking. M&T Bank operates over 900 branches across 13 states and Washington, D.C., offering a range of services including retail and commercial banking, wealth management through Wilmington Trust, and corporate trust services.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $31.45 billion, M&T Bank is a significant player in the financial services sector, specifically within the banking industry. The bank's strategic positioning and diverse service offerings contribute to its competitive edge in the market.\n\n## Financial Health Analysis\n\nM&T Bank has demonstrated consistent financial performance, with a [revenue growth](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rvn-growth-3y/MTB) rate of 6% over the past three years. The bank's profitability is underscored by a [net margin](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/net-margin/MTB) of 29.05% and a [pretax margin](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pretax-margin/MTB) of 37.74%, indicating efficient operations and strong earnings capacity.\n\nOn the balance sheet front, M&T Bank maintains a [debt-to-equity ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/debt-to-equity/MTB) of 0.52, reflecting prudent financial management. The bank's [return on equity](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/roe/MTB) stands at 9.62%, showcasing its ability to generate returns on shareholder investments.\n\nHowever, there are some warning signs to consider. The bank's [insider activity](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/insider-sell/MTB) indicates two insider selling transactions in the past three months, totaling 11,250 shares. Additionally, the bank's asset growth rate of 12.5% outpaces its revenue growth rate, which may suggest decreasing efficiency.\n\n## Valuation & Market Sentiment\n\nM&T Bank's current valuation metrics suggest a modestly overvalued position. The bank's [P/E ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pe-ratio/MTB) is 12.6, while its [P/S ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/MTB) is 3.46, both within historical ranges. The [P/B ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pb-ratio/MTB) is close to its one-year high, indicating potential overvaluation concerns.\n\nAnalyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with a target price of $219.88 and a recommendation score of 2.2. Technical indicators such as the [RSI](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rsi-14/MTB) of 68.64 suggest the stock is approaching overbought territory, warranting careful monitoring.\n\nInstitutional ownership is high at 91.21%, reflecting strong confidence from large investors, while insider ownership is relatively low at 2.58%.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nM&T Bank's financial health is supported by a high [Piotroski F-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/fscore/MTB) of 7, indicating a robust financial position. The [Beneish M-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/mscore/MTB) of -2.52 suggests the company is unlikely to be manipulating its financial statements.\n\nSector-specific risks include potential regulatory changes and economic fluctuations that could impact the banking industry. The bank's [beta](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/beta/MTB) of 1.25 indicates higher volatility compared to the market, which investors should consider when assessing risk.\n\nOverall, M&T Bank's strategic positioning, financial health, and market sentiment present a mixed picture, with strong fundamentals tempered by valuation concerns and sector-specific risks.\n\n_This stock alert was generated using automated technology and GuruFocus financial data to provide readers with timely and accurate market reporting.

A few years from now, you’ll probably wish you’d bought this stock.\n\n###### Published on November 14, 2025 at by [Inan Dogan, PhD](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/author/inandogan/)\n\nWhen Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.\n\nFast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described **generative AI** as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.\n\nAt the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by **2040** there would be **at least 10 billion humanoid robots**, with each priced between **$20,000 and $25,000**.\n\nDo the math. According to Musk, **this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.**\n\nPut another way, that’s roughly equal to:\n\n- 175 Teslas\n- 107 Amazons\n- 140 Metas\n- 84 Googles\n- 65 Microsofts\n- And 55 Nvidias\n\nAnd here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave **isn’t** tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.\n\nIt’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.\n\nEven if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.\n\n**How could anything be worth that much?**\n\nThe answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.\n\nAnd this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.\n\nWhat most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.\n\nIn fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.\n\nBefore I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.\n\n- Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.\n- Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.\n- Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.\n\nWhen billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.\n\nEven as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…\n\nBut the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.\n\nAnd judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…\n\nThis prediction might not be bold at all:\n\nA few years from now, you’ll wish you’d owned this stock.\n\nThe best part?

The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!\n\nAI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.\n\nEach ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, **AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink**.\n\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:\n\n**Where will all of that energy come from?**\n\nAI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes **as much energy as a small city**. And it’s about to get worse.\n\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:\n\n“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”\n\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\n“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”\n\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. **Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.**\n\nAnd that’s where the real opportunity lies…\n\n**One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play.** It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.\n\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\n\n**The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom**\n\n- It owns critical **nuclear energy infrastructure assets**, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.\n- It’s one of the **only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects** across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays **a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation**—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.\n\nTrump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy **American** LNG.\n\nAnd our company sits in the toll booth— **collecting fees on every drop exported.**\n\nBut that’s not all…\n\nAs Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be **first in line** to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.\n\n**AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.**\n\nWhile the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company **powering it all from behind the scenes**.\n\nAI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.\n\nAnd infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.\n\nThis company has its finger in every pie—and **Wall Street is just starting to notice**.\n\nWall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.\n\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…\n\n**This company is completely debt-free.**\n\nIn fact, it’s sitting on a **war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap**.\n\nIt also owns a **huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play**, giving investors **indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines** without paying a premium.\n\nAnd here’s what the smart money has started whispering…\n\n**The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out**\n\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that **some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits**.\n\nThey’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\n\nWhy? Because **excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings**.\n\nAnd that’s for a business tied to:\n\n- The **AI infrastructure supercycle**\n- The **onshoring boom** driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in **U.S. LNG exports**\n- And a unique footprint in **nuclear energy**—the future of clean, reliable power\n\nYou simply won’t find another AI and energy stock **this cheap**… with **this much upside**.\n\n**This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.**\n\nIt’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\n\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\n\n**Disruption is the New Name of the Game:** Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.\n\nAI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.\n\nThe companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.\n\nAs an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.\n\n**The Talent Pool is Overflowing:** The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.\n\nFrom computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.\n\nThis influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.\n\nBy investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.\n\nThe future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.\n\nDon’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.\n\nDive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.\n\nThis isn’t just about making money – it’s about being part of the future.\n\nSo, buckle up and get ready for the ride of your investment life!\n\n**Act Now and Unlock a Potential 100+% Return within 12 to 24 months.**\n\nWe’re now **offering month-to-month subscriptions with no commitments**.\n\nFor a ridiculously low price of just **$9.99 per month**, you can unlock our in-depth investment research and exclusive insights – that’s less than a single fast food meal!\n\n### Here’s why this is a deal you can’t afford to pass up:\n\n- **Access to our Detailed Report on our AI, Tariffs, and Nuclear Energy Stock with 100+% potential upside within 12 to 24 months**\n- **BONUS REPORT on our #1 AI-Robotics Stock with 10000% upside potential:** Our in-depth report dives deep into our #1 AI/robotics stock’s groundbreaking technology and massive growth potential.\n- **One New Issue of Our Premium Readership Newsletter:** You will also receive one new issue per month and at least one new stock pick per month from our monthly newsletter’s portfolio over the next 12 months.

Piedmont Reliability Project.\n\n![](https://www.wfmd.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Co-Ex-Jessica-Fitzwater-1024x1024.jpeg)\n\nFrederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater\n\nFrederick, Md (KM) Frederick County has joined other local governments and other parties in asking the Public Service Commission to dismiss the application from Public Service Enterprise Group to construct the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project. “We are joining a motion to actually dismiss the case due to the fact the schedule that the Public Service Commission has put out is really not going to allow this project to move in the time frame that they have to,” says Frederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater, who was a guest recently on WFMD’s “Morning News Express.”\n\nPSEG has asked for approval by the PSC by March, 2026, with the line up and running by June, 2027   PJM, which manages the regional grid, says the region could be subject to potential power blackouts and voltage collapse by June, 2027  if nothing’s done. . The PSC’s schedule pushes final briefs to February, 2027.\n\nMPRP is a proposed 67-mile electric transmission line beginning in northern Baltimore County, continuing through central Carroll County and into southern Frederick County, ending at the Doubs substation in Adamstown. Opponents say Maryland won’t be seeing any of that electricity transmitting through those wires. Instead, it will be going to northern Virginia to power data centers.\n\nFitzwater says these electric lines will pass over a number of agricultural properties. “The route is proposed to go through land that is under agricultural easements.; land preservation easements, in some cases. floodplains or other natural sensitive areas,” she says. “These are in some cases farms where property owners have spent generations working this land, and putting their own investments into preserving this land.”\n\nEven though local governments have no say in whether utility projects  like MPRP, are approved or denied, Fitzwater says she and other officials and citizens can  let the PSC know how they feel. “What we are doing is really amplifying the voice of our residents, especially the property owners that are being impacted by the proposed route,” she says.\n\nIn her comments on WFMD,  County Executive Fitzwater says PSEG has done everything  wrong when it comes to public outreach for the project. “From the beginning, this company—this New Jersey based company, PSEG—is just done really a poster child for how not to do community engagement, No communication with folks in the community that are going to be impacted by this; complete lack of transparency,” she says.\n\nDespite the controversy about MPRP, Fitzwater says Maryland has some energy problems. “Pretty common knowledge that Maryland is an importer of energy and not a generator of energy,” she says. “And so this question is coming up. But we can’t let the need for change to impact these lands that we’re seeing happen with this proposed project.”\n\nBy Kevin McManus\n\n![](https://thrtle.com/sync?vxii_pid=7004)\n\n[Powered By SoCast](https://www.socastdigital.com/)\n\nLoading...\n\n![](https://static.tunegenie.com/static/images/covers/defaultcover170.jpg)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nMENU\n\n[play](https://b3.tunegenie.com/?tgv=cd90572.2008133b# \"play\")\n\nInvalid date\n\nBackControls\n\nLoading...\n\nClick a Day To See Song History\n\nDecember 2025\n\nS\n\nM\n\nT\n\nW\n\nT\n\nF\n\nS\n\n30\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nLoading...\n\n00:00\n\n-00:00\n\n1\n\nListen Live\n\nListen Live"

Yum Brands — parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger & Grill — has launched its first-ever food trends report in partnership with its internal agency Collider Lab, pulling proprietary insights from across its 62,000-plus restaurants in more than 155 countries and territories.\n\nSeveral themes emerged from this research, including shifts toward personalization and solo dining. Personal-style pizzas, for instance, outperform with younger consumers, while 31% of custom orders are made for groups of two.\n\n“Once social foods like pizza and wings are now being reimagined for one. Consumers are embracing meals that reflect their individual tastes, not the group’s,” the report said. “The result? The ‘me-me-me economy’ is in full swing.”\n\nMeanwhile, solo orders have increased by 52% since 2021 and now make up 47% of all quick-service dining occasions, versus 31% in 2021. This trend is corroborated by new Toast data showing that single diner reservations spiked by 22% in the third quarter.\n\nThis trend is perhaps impacting the value environment, as 68% of solo diners choose not to take advantage of a deal, and more than half spend $10 to $30 during a visit. In other words, solo diners are proving they’re willing to spend more, as solo dining is more about self-care than deal seeking, according to the report.\n\nRelated: [In-N-Out, Hardee’s, Wendy’s](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/in-n-out-hardee-s-wendy-s)\n\nOf course, value remains top of mind most consumers and 62% say a good value is something “cheap and affordable,” while 47% of value-seeking occasions occur in the drive-thru.\n\nAnother theme is that consumers are seeking “choice therapy” in response to being overwhelmed by external factors. Choice therapy, according to Yum, means “reclaiming agency through small, sensory choices.” In other words, they want to be in control of even the smallest decisions.\n\nThis may explain why consumers are gravitating toward specialty beverages and sauces, which allow them the ability to customize their orders in a number of ways. Yum’s research shows that sauces are 2.4 times more likely to bring excitement to consumers versus other food items. Technomic data shows that 34% of consumers now consider what sauces are available when [deciding on a restaurant](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/in-qsr-sauces-start-to-command-a-bigger-spotlight).  Unsurprisingly, Taco Bell and KFC have both stepped up their sauce game in recent quarters, with launches such as [Frank’s RedHot Diablo Sauce](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/taco-bell-teams-up-with-frank-s-redhot-for-new-diablo-sauce) and [Original Honey BBQ, respectively](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/kfc-brings-back-original-honey-bbq-in-turnaround-bid). More than 70% of KFC’s best-selling menu item tests include specific sauces.\n\nRelated: [Wendy’s jumps on the quarter zip trend with soft drink promotion](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/wendy-s-jumps-on-the-quarter-zip-trend-with-soft-drink-promotion)\n\nFurther, KFC’s Saucy brand, which is [expanding throughout Florida](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/kfc-s-saucy-concept-opening-three-locations), is centered on 11 signature sauces, as well as a rotating lineup of limited-time sauces. The company said there are more than 4,000 ways to order from Saucy.\n\nHaving such control over these types of small decisions are driving outperformance from “build your own” concepts. Taco Bell’s build your own Luxe Box offerings, for instance, generate 72% positive sentiment. Customized occasions also tend to motivate customers to spend more, according to the report.\n\n“Boxes and curated meal bundles have become symbols of control. They invoke structured abundance in an overwhelming world. They promise limits amid endless options. Variety, but not chaos. Choice, but not decision fatigue,” the report said.\n\nFinally, the report outlines that younger consumers are approaching food “through emotional value rather than logic.” This means they’re considering a brand’s vibe over food, little pick-me-ups — like snacks — during the week, and beverages. Nearly 70% of afternoon snack occasions happen on weekdays, while one in four young consumers think of a QSR trip as a special occasion. Further, 43% of specialty beverages are purchased without a food attachment, and 61% of specialty beverage occasions include order customizations such as toppings or flavor shots.\n\nRelated: [In-N-Out makes its Tennessee debut](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/in-n-out-makes-its-tennessee-debut)\n\n“We’re in an era of emotional economics,” the report said. “Amid rising costs and endless choices, younger consumers are constantly performing tiny vibe checks, deciding not just what to buy, but how it makes them feel.”\n\nContact Alicia Kelso at [Alicia.Kelso@informa.com](mailto:Alicia.Kelso@informa.com)\n\nFollow her on TikTok: @aliciakelso\n\nRead more about:\n\n[KFC](https://www.nrn.com/keyword/kfc) [Taco Bell](https://www.nrn.com/keyword/taco-bell) [Pizza Hut Inc.](https://www.nrn.com/keyword/pizza-hut-inc) [Habit Burger & Grill](https://www.nrn.com/keyword/the-habit-burger-grill) [Yum Brands](https://www.nrn.com/keyword/yum-brands)\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/yum-brands-trend-report-shows-younger-consumers-want-control-of-their-dining-experience)[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/yum-brands-trend-report-shows-younger-consumers-want-control-of-their-dining-experience)[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/yum-brands-trend-report-shows-younger-consumers-want-control-of-their-dining-experience)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/yum-brands-trend-report-shows-younger-consumers-want-control-of-their-dining-experience&title=Yum%20Brands%20trend%20report%20shows%20younger%20consumers%20want%20control%20of%20their%20dining%20experience)[Email](mailto:?subject=Yum%20Brands%20trend%20report%20shows%20younger%20consumers%20want%20control%20of%20their%20dining%20experience&body=I%20thought%20the%20following%20from%20Nation%27s%20Restaurant%20News%20might%20interest%20you.%0D%0A%0D%0A%20Yum%20Brands%20trend%20report%20shows%20younger%20consumers%20want%20control%20of%20their%20dining%20experience%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrn.com%2Fquick-service%2Fyum-brands-trend-report-shows-younger-consumers-want-control-of-their-dining-experience)\n\n## About the Author\n\n[![Alicia Kelso](https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltea7aee2fca050a19/blt3ea791c86a6f90bd/6707c61c4c7533d182fe222a/Alicia_20Kelso_20Nations_20Restaurant_20News.JPG?width=400&auto=webp&quality=80&disable=upscale)](https://www.nrn.com/author/alicia-kelso)\n\n[Alicia Kelso](https://www.nrn.com/author/alicia-kelso)\n\nExecutive Editor, Nation's Restaurant News\n\nAlicia Kelso is the executive editor of Nation's Restaurant News.

Please let us know if you have [feedback](https://www.restaurantdive.com/contact/).\n\n\nSolo dining occasions now comprise almost half (47%) of quick-service restaurant occasions, up by more than 50% since 2021, when solo dining accounted for 31% of QSR occasions, according to data from a Yum Brands report [on major consumer trends](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251210690450/en/From-Craveable-Drinks-to-Sauce-Rituals-Yum-Brands-Unveils-its-First-Ever-Food-Trends-Report).\n\nYum Brands’ Chief Marketing Officer Ken Muench told Restaurant Dive that cultural factors are reshaping consumer demand for restaurant occasions.\n\nMuench posited, based on data collected by Yum’s in-house data analytics team, Collider Labs, that three major shifts are ongoing for consumers right now.\n\nFirst, consumers are shifting toward premium, solo occasions within QSR — Yum’s data shows that more than half of solo occasions produce checks in the $10-$30 range, with orders overindexing on snacks and drinks. Consumers are also shifting from group dining to solo dining, changing the consumption patterns for socially oriented dishes, like pizza and wings.\n\nSecond, consumers are using customization as a means of exerting emotional control over their lives, in a broadly unstable socio-political context, Muench said.\n\nThird, consumer value perceptions are shifting away from price toward factors like aesthetics and perceived coolness.\n\n“These three \\[factors\\] are really fascinating because they’re really contextually critical at the moment with what’s happening with the world, and the lack of predictability, lack of control, and the sense consumers have,” Muench said.\n\nThis particular historical contingency meant Yum was interested in sharing the results of its Collider Labs data with the public, Muench said. The company has produced similar reports since 2014, but this is the first time it has gone public with the results.\n\n### How customization reshapes value\n\nYum’s report found that solo diners do not always exploit discounts — 68% of consumers reported not taking advantage of deals. Solo dining, then, Yum said in the report, is more about “little luxuries for self care,” rather than price-based deal-seeking.\n\nBecause of the emotional weight diners are putting on food, customization has become more important, Meunch said. According to the report, customizable meal boxes and bundles are one important way for consumers to attain that sense of control.\n\n“Build Your Own and Cravings Box concepts consistently outperform purely convenience-led ideas because they give consumers the power to design their perfect meal,” the report said.\n\nKeep up with the story.

Those Luxe Boxes, Muench said, give consumers the ability to choose elements of a meal without imposing a paralyzing variety of decisions.\n\nConsumers are opting for customizable spice levels, dipping sauces and other flavor tweaks, as well.\n\n“In moments of stress, sauces act as emotional pick-me-ups,” the company argued.\n\nMany QSR brands have added to their sauce repertoires over the last year. Popeyes, a Restaurant Brands International chain, added a signature sauce to its menu [over the summer](https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/popeyes-signature-sauce-chicken-dippers/752919/). The launches of both McDonald’s and Wendy’s [chicken tenders](https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/wendys-tendys-chicken-tender-debut-sauces/761470/) this year [included signature sauces](https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/mcdonalds-chicken-strips-may-5-debut-menu-strategy/746282/).\n\nConsumers who feel greater control over their experiences may be more likely to spend more on average, about 48% of occasions where consumers seek out customization have checks greater than $20, according to [Yum’s presentation](https://www.yum.com/wps/wcm/connect/yumbrands/8dadd091-3663-4548-89c2-a349147d25c8/Collider+Food+Trends+Report+2026+FINAL.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=pI3Ruxe).\n\nThat premium pay for custom experiences is helping fuel Yum’s third trend — consumer perception of value as something beyond price. Muench said that in previous historical eras the price point predominated in value perception, but customization, social media hype and other forces are restructuring diners’ relationship to food.\n\n“Food is acting as a sort of form of self expression, as this thing that makes you enjoy a social environment,” Muench said. “Because of that, then, I’m not just doing the math on the pounds per dollar.

Brands is initiated at a \"Sell\" rating due to structural challenges and limited upside from a potential Pizza Hut divestiture.\n- Pizza Hut's declining comps, shrinking margins, and weak demand make a value-accretive sale unlikely, offering minimal relief for YUM's $11.3 billion debt load.\n- YUM's leverage remains high at 4x, with capital allocation focused on acquisitions and C-suite expansion rather than aggressive cost control.\n- KFC and Taco Bell divisions show resilient comp growth, but YUM's premium valuation is unjustified given persistent underperformance and balance sheet risk.\n\n![Pizza Hut restaurant and takeaway on a high street in Manchester city centre](https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1465801129/image_1465801129.jpg?io=getty-c-w630)\n\nWirestock/iStock Editorial via Getty Images\n\nWith all the volatility that we’ve experienced this year, there is little doubt that one of the most troubled sectors in the stock market this year is the restaurant space.

Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM), in collaboration with its internal strategy agency Collider Lab, today released its first-ever trends report. The _2026 Food Trends Report: What’s Next in Dining_ uncovers the cultural and consumer shifts shaping how and what people will eat in 2026, offering insights on the evolving expectations of modern diners. With more than 62,000 restaurants worldwide, Yum! has an unmatched view into what’s happening across global food culture, making this an unprecedented inside industry look.\n\nDrawing on research, behavioral insights, and learnings from Yum!’s four iconic global brands – KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Habit Burger & Grill – _The 2026 Food Trends Report_ shows how consumers are increasingly using food to reclaim a sense of agency in a fast-changing world. People are turning to food not just for convenience, but for experiences that give a sense of control by reflecting individual tastes and moods through personalization and hands-on engagement.\n\n“Our global footprint gives us unique visibility into the ever-changing ways people order and experience food,” said Ken Muench, Chief Marketing Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc. and Co-Founder of Collider Lab. “ _The 2026 Food Trends Report_ helps us see where culture is headed and gives our brands a clearer path to creating more moments of joyful, flavorful ownership for our customers.”\n\nBelow is a snapshot of three trends highlighted in the report. To view the full report, click [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yum.com%2Fwps%2Fportal%2Fyumbrands%2FYumbrands%2Fnews%2Fcompany-stories-article%2FYum%2BBrands%2Bx%2BCollider%2BLab%2B2026%2BFood%2BTrends%2BReport&esheet=54373335&newsitemid=20251210690450&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=1&md5=1f334ba892051bf6e0d66e1ee9b79084).\n\n**The Me-Me-Me Economy**\n\nConsumers are reshaping dining around personal expression and autonomy. Foods once meant for social gatherings are being redesigned for one, reflecting a shift toward food that matches individual identity and mood:\n\n- **It’s About Me, Even When It’s “We”:** There is a need for personalization and autonomy, even when dining with others. Personal-size pizzas are outperforming with Gen Z and Millennials, and 31% of custom orders are made within customer groups of two.\n\n- **Solo Dining as Self-Care:** Solo orders have grown by 52% since 2021 (making up 47% of QSR dining occasions, compared to 31% in 2021), with people opting out of group meals to instead treat themselves. 68% of solo diners choose not to take advantage of a deal and over half spend $10–$30+ during a visit, suggesting diners are willing to pay more when dining alone.\n\n- **Satisfying a Craving:** Validating that meals can reflect individual tastes rather than the group’s, research shows that 24% of solo diners are out to satisfy a craving.\n\n\n**Choice Therapy**\n\nIn a world that can feel chaotic, consumers are gravitating toward small, sensory decisions that create moments of emotional grounding:\n\n- **Build Your Own Power:** Boxes and bundles are becoming symbols of control. Concepts that let consumers create their own meals consistently outperform convenience-led ideas. At Taco Bell, Build Your Own Taco offerings generated 72% positive sentiment.\n\n- **Sauces as Emotional Excitement:** Sauces can be a top tool for an emotional reset, with consumers saying that sauces are 2.4x more likely to bring excitement to the everyday compared to other food items.\n\n- **Flavor Tweaks as Empowerment:** Whether dipping, shaking, or fine-tuning spice levels, small rituals are giving consumers a sense of agency. At KFC, 71% of its top-performing menu item tests had specific sauces, reinforcing how influential customizable flavors have become.\n\n\n**Vibe-Mathing**\n\nAs consumers navigate rising costs and endless choices, they are now approaching food through emotional value rather than just logic. Items that feel uplifting or aesthetically satisfying increasingly impact decisions as much as the price tag, reflecting a shift toward what feels good in the moment:\n\n- **Cool Counts:** The #1 attribute driving momentum for quick-service restaurant brands is whether a brand “is very cool,” even outranking whether a restaurant has craveable food.\n\n- **Everyday Little Luxuries:** People are craving pick-me-ups throughout the week, with 68% of afternoon snack occasions (think fries or sweet treats) happening on weekdays. Consumers are looking for products that deliver a mood boost, with 1 in 4 young consumers (aged 18 – 29) seeing a trip to QSR as a special occasion.\n\n- **Drinks for Dopamine:** Modern beverages have emerged as low-stakes indulgences with high emotional return. Drinks are small but accessible joys, with 43% of specialty beverages purchased standalone without the customer buying any food.\n\n\nTogether, these three trends capture the shifting dynamics of choice, value and experience across the food landscape. _The 2026 Food Trends Report_ puts Yum! Brands, Inc. at the forefront of this evolution. Through its global scale and Collider Lab’s cultural foresight, the company brings clarity to the forces shaping consumer behavior and the innovations that will guide dining's next chapter.\n\n**About Yum!

They’ve mastered limited-time offers that create urgency, like the ‘Bajaversary’ for Baja Blast, which pulled in customers and spiked visits,” Paul Drecksler, an e-commerce expert and founder of Shopifreaks, told [The Food Institute](https://foodinstitute.com/focus/dynamic-menu-savvy-marketing-key-to-taco-bell-boom/).\n\nAnother industry expert, Organic Solace CEO Ken Tobby, said the Mexican chain’s LTOs help fuel its success.\n\n“This approach usually brings about repeat visits and sales spikes, as people do not want to miss out,” he shared.\n\nThe chain has also scored with its affordable menu items at a time when consumers are demanding them.\n\n“Taco Bell’s affordability strategy has become a lifeline for budget-conscious consumers.

Taco Bell International continued to build momentum, adding 27 gross new units and successfully launching 2 new markets, Greece and Ireland,” the CEO added.\n\nMore growth is ahead for the chain.\n\n“On the back of accelerating sales, we remain on track to deliver 100 international net new units this year, reflecting energized franchise partners, compelling brand marketing, and improving unit-level economics around the world,” Turner shared.\n\nFinancial planner Steven Kibbel, chief editorial adviser at Gold IRA Cos, believes Taco Bell’s success comes from its ability to innovate while maintaining value.\n\n“They’re quick to adjust to trends with items that appeal to budget-conscious consumers, which helps sustain growth in a tough market,” Kibbel told The Food Institute. “It’s not just the novelty factor, but also the efficiency in their operations and pricing strategy that helps them stay competitive.”\n\n[View post: Amazon solves Walmart, Target, and Kroger’s shoplifting problem](https://www.thestreet.com/retail/amazon-solves-walmart-target-and-krogers-shoplifting-problem-just-walk-out)![](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_16:9/NDA6MDAwMDAwMDAyNzk0NzIx/checkout-lead.jpg?arena_f_auto)\n\nRetail\n\n## [Amazon solves Walmart, Target, and Kroger’s shoplifting problem](https://www.thestreet.com/retail/amazon-solves-walmart-target-and-krogers-shoplifting-problem-just-walk-out)\n\n- [CVS](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/CVS)\n- [KR](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/KR)\n- [TGT](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/TGT)\n\n[View post: 77-year-old convenience store chain closing all stores after sale](https://www.thestreet.com/retail/77-year-old-convenience-store-chain-closing-all-its-stores-after-sale)![](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_16:9/NDA6MDAwMDAwMDAyNzc2NDc4/convenience-store-drinks-lead.jpg?arena_f_auto)\n\nRetail\n\n## [77-year-old convenience store chain closing all stores after sale](https://www.thestreet.com/retail/77-year-old-convenience-store-chain-closing-all-its-stores-after-sale)\n\n[View post: American Airlines now lets you buy top loyalty status](https://www.thestreet.com/travel/american-airlines-makes-passengers-a-major-loyalty-program-offer)![](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_16:9/MTgzNzIyNzE4ODEyNzEwNDA0/american-airlines_2.jpg?arena_f_auto)\n\nTravel\n\n## [American Airlines now lets you buy top loyalty status](https://www.thestreet.com/travel/american-airlines-makes-passengers-a-major-loyalty-program-offer)\n\n[View post: T‑Mobile’s bold move sparks fury at Verizon and AT&T](https://www.thestreet.com/retail/t-mobile-fixes-the-biggest-smartphone-customer-pain-point)![](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_16:9/NDA6MDAwMDAwMDAyNzk0MjQ3/t-mobile-store-walk-lead.jpg?arena_f_auto)\n\nRetail\n\n## [T‑Mobile’s bold move sparks fury at Verizon and AT&T](https://www.thestreet.com/retail/t-mobile-fixes-the-biggest-smartphone-customer-pain-point)\n\n- [T](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/T)\n- [TMUS](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/TMUS)\n- [VZ](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/VZ)\n\n## About the authors\n\n![](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_1:1/MjA2OTE3NTA4NzY5MjYwNTk1/dan-1.jpg?arena_f_auto)\n\n## [Daniel Kline](https://www.thestreet.com/author/daniel-kline)\n\nFollow\n\nDaniel Kline serves as co-editor-in-chief of TheStreet.

FFA (short for Future Farmers of America) is a nonprofit dedicated to changing the lives of students and furthering their leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricultural education.\n\n\"I'm extremely excited about expanding our relationship with FFA,\" said Casey Miller, Fastenal’s senior executive vice president of sales. \"The future of farming and food production in our country is such an important priority and Fastenal is here to do its part.\"\n\nWith the new sponsorship, Mr. Miller joins the National FFA Sponsors' Board and Fastenal expands its presence at the National FFA Convention and Expo held each October. In addition, Fastenal will continue to provide targeted support to FFA members and chapters across the country by:\n\n- **Advancing agricultural education and leadership through local chapter and state grants for members.** These grants financially support the mission of the FFA through donations directly to state associations and individual chapters.\n\n- **Investing in students via the Fastenal Innovators Scholarship.** Through the FFA grant application system, students can now apply for five Fastenal-funded college scholarships.\n\n- **Fostering belonging and pride with the 'Give the Gift of Blue' program.** Fastenal's financial support helps provide members with FFA Blue Jackets, fostering a sense of pride and belonging in the organization.\n\n\nIn short, as an official partner, Fastenal has an opportunity to provide greater support and guidance to the next generation of biologists, chemists, veterinarians, engineers, entrepreneurs, and, of course, farmers.\n\n\"As a former member and officer of the FFA, specifically the Ellsworth, Wisconsin chapter, I'm a big believer in what they do,\" said Fastenal's CEO, Dan Florness. \"I also had the honor of serving on the National FFA Sponsors' Board, so I saw their impact up close and personal. FFA is a great organization, and Fastenal is proud to support their efforts to develop the next generation of leaders inside and outside of agriculture.\"\n\nFor more information on Fastenal's community involvement, view our annual ESG report at, [www.fastenal.com/fast/esg](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastenal.com%2Ffast%2Fesg&esheet=54370440&newsitemid=20251205661868&lan=en-US&anchor=www.fastenal.com%2Ffast%2Fesg&index=2&md5=b4aa9d7ec9dd5ede0beb06f6ee651038).\n\n**About Fastenal**\n\nWith approximately 1,600 branch locations spanning 25 countries, Fastenal supplies a broad offering of fasteners, safety products, metal cutting products, and other industrial supplies to customers engaged in manufacturing, construction, warehouse and storage, data centers, wholesale, and federal, state, and local government.

November’s 6.2% net sales and 11.8% daily sales growth support the near term catalyst of revenue-led margin support, but they do not eliminate the key risk that higher freight, tariffs, and SG&A could still weigh on profitability if demand cools.\n\nAmong recent announcements, the 2-for-1 stock split approved in April 2025 stands out in the context of Fastenal’s stronger November sales. While the split itself does not change fundamentals, it sits alongside a pattern of consistent dividends and volume growth that many investors watch when weighing the near term upside from improved sales against the risk of ongoing margin pressure.\n\nYet while sales momentum looks encouraging, investors should still be aware of how persistent cost and margin pressures could...\n\n[Read the full narrative on Fastenal (it's free!)](https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-fast/fastenal/ei8gojit-digital-solutions-and-resilient-supply-chains-will-drive-future-strength-ghav)\n\nFastenal's narrative projects $9.9 billion revenue and $1.6 billion earnings by 2028.

Full-time selling personnel headcount ended November at 15,452 — flat vs. October and up 2.6% year-over-year.\n\n#### **MDM’s Analysis**\n\nFastenal tapped former Beko Europe CFO Max Tunnicliff [to the same position effective Nov. 10](https://www.mdm.com/news/top-distributor-sectors/fasteners/fastenal-taps-whirlpool-veteran-as-new-cfo/), and the month’s sales report was a nice start for his tenure. Fastenal is the only publicly traded industrial distributor that shares a monthly sales report, which can make it a good barometer for the overall health and demand status for the industrial supplies/MRO/construction markets it serves.\n\nHowever, much of the company’s recent growth should be viewed as Fastenal-specific rather than illustrating underlying demand momentum, given the company’s recent pricing actions and broader business strategy. In its Q3 financials, the company noted a pricing impact that grew 240-270 basis points year-over-year, which was lower than it expected, but Fastenal noted that “pricing actions continue to progress.”\n\nWith November’s report showing sustained strong daily sales growth entering the final month of the year across each of the company’s three broad product categories, it indicates lasting momentum for Fastenal heading into 2026.\n\n[**MDM Case Study: LINC Systems**](https://www.mdm.com/product/linc-systems-case-study/) [(Premium access here)](https://www.mdm.com/monthlies-reports/mdm-case-study-linc-systems/)\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\n“Beyond the near term, we continue to assume FAST is growing daily sales low-double-digits over 2026 and high-single-digits in 2027 even assuming just normal sequentials, with accelerating company-specific momentum,” Baird continued. “We continue to assume near-term contribution margins that are towards the high end of normalized 20-25% ranges (~23-24%) — aided by pricing and leverage on employee expenses on strong growth and potentially more stable headcount.”\n\n### Related Posts\n\n- [Fastenal 3Q Sales Grew 11.7%](https://www.mdm.com/news/operations/earnings/fastenal-3q-sales-grew-11-7/)\n\n[![](https://www.mdm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fastenal-wad-150x150.jpeg)](https://www.mdm.com/news/operations/earnings/fastenal-3q-sales-grew-11-7/)\n\n\n\nDespite \"sluggish\" market conditions, Fastenal records its third straight month of double-digit daily sales growth.\n\n- [Fastenal's Sales Momentum Rolls Along in August](https://www.mdm.com/news/top-distributor-sectors/contractor/fastenals-sales-momentum-rolls-along-in-august/)\n\n[![](https://www.mdm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fastenal-wad-150x150.jpeg)](https://www.mdm.com/news/top-distributor-sectors/contractor/fastenals-sales-momentum-rolls-along-in-august/)\n\n\n\nThe company's August sales report showed that double-digit daily sales growth continued, albeit at a…\n\n- [Fastenal's Sales Ramp Continues as Pricing Actions Take Hold](https://www.mdm.com/news/top-distributor-sectors/contractor/fastenals-sales-ramp-continues-as-pricing-actions-take-hold/)\n\n[![](https://www.mdm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fastenal-box-150x150.jpg)](https://www.mdm.com/news/top-distributor-sectors/contractor/fastenals-sales-ramp-continues-as-pricing-actions-take-hold/)\n\n\n\nThe company's July report showed its first double-digit year-over-year daily sales growth month since January…\n\n\n#### Share this article\n\n- Filed In: [Construction](https://www.mdm.com/category/top-distributor-sectors/construction/), [Contractor](https://www.mdm.com/category/top-distributor-sectors/contractor/), [Earnings](https://www.mdm.com/category/tech-operations/operations/earnings/), [Facilities Maintenance (MRO)](https://www.mdm.com/category/top-distributor-sectors/facilities-maintenance-mro/), [Fasteners](https://www.mdm.com/category/top-distributor-sectors/fasteners/), [Industrial Supplies](https://www.mdm.com/category/top-distributor-sectors/industrial-supplies/), [News](https://www.mdm.com/category/breaking-news-in-wholesale-distribution/)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[![Picture of Mike Hockett](https://www.mdm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hockett-2025a-e1753474482895-300x300.jpg)](https://www.mdm.com/author/mikemdm-com/)\n\n[**Mike Hockett**](https://www.mdm.com/author/mikemdm-com/)\n\nMike Hockett is MDM's executive editor, having joined the publication in March 2022.

The companies make medicine like Tylenol and Benadryl.\n\nPaxton told KVUE a district court issued [a temporary restraining order](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Kenvue%20TRO.pdf) blocking the companies from doing business in Texas. The court found the companies are operating as unregistered foreign entities.\n\nOnce they register with the state, they will need to follow Texas court jurisdiction.\n\nNext week, a court is expected to decide whether they will have to completely stop doing business in Texas, if they refuse to register.\n\nPaxton said he's committed to holding pharmaceutical companies accountable and putting Texans' well-being first.\n\n“I will not allow Big Pharma to operate above the law or put their greed ahead of Texans’ well-being,” said Paxton. “Kenvue and J&J have shown themselves to be corporations focused on seeking profits above all else, no matter how unethical or illegal their actions may be. The reign of these foreign corporations operating in Texas without even registering or acknowledging our laws ends now.”\n\nKVUE reached out to Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue. A spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson said they expect the temporary restraining order to be denied and the case to be dismissed.\n\n\"The recent order pertains to the same issues asserted in a prior pending matter commenced just weeks ago and, as in that prior pending matter, we expect the TRO to be denied and the case against J&J to be dismissed,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nKVUE has reached out and is waiting to hear back from Kenvue.\n\nThis comes as the Attorney General's Office is tied up in separate lawsuits with the two Tylenol makers.\n\nIn October, [the attorney general claimed](https://www.kvue.com/video/news/state/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-suing-johnson-and-johnson-tylenol-autism-claims/269-3ce0d2a2-8ded-4bd9-8ad6-9c203c1ab286) Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue did not properly warn Texans about a link between Tylenol and autism.

Some of the most frequent questions were about whether it's legal for surf or bank fisherman to use drones to deploy bait.\n\nTPWD staff reviewed [Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 19.11](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-50/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-19), or the Federal Airborne Hunting Act (AHA), which was first enacted in 1956. They also sought guidance from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Office of Law Enforcement.\n\nTPWD found those regulations prohibit the use of aircraft, including UAS or drones, to \"take or attempt to take wildlife, or aid in the act of fishing.\"\n\nTPWD said the regulations also prohibit the department from issuing permits to allow drone use for the purpose of \"sport hunting,\" including recreational or sport fishing.\n\nClose Ad\n\nLoading next article..."

That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday.\n\nKimberly-Clark shareholders are expected to own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46%.\n\nThe combination merges two businesses that own a number of major consumer health brands, such as Kimberly-Clark's Kleenex and Scott lines and Kenvue's Band-Aid, Benadryl, Listerine and Neutrogena products.\n\n\"We will serve billions of consumers across every stage of life,\" Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu said in a statement. He will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined company.\n\nRecently, Kenvue's Tylenol has drawn headlines after President Trump [announced](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-autism-tylenol-medical-experts/) the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of the pain medication's active ingredient, acetaminophen, during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism. Medical experts and Kenvue say Tylenol is safe.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both companies.\n\nKenvue said in July that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving as part of a strategic review of the company's business. Board member Kirk Perry is serving as interim CEO.\n\nThe combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark's headquarters in Irving, Texas, and continue to have a significant presence in Kenvue's locations.\n\n# In:\n\n- [Health](https://www.cbsnews.com/healthwatch/)\n- [Tylenol](https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/tylenol/)\n\nA closer look at Trump's medical advice post\n\n[Breaking down Trump's comments on vaccines and Tylenol04:28](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/fact-checking-trumps-vaccine-comments/)\n\n#### Breaking down Trump's comments on vaccines and Tylenol\n\n(04:28)\n\n\n- [**Paramount Skydance makes $108.4 billion bid for Warner Bros.

They closed down 42 cents, or 2.5%, at $16.24.\n\nMonday's hearing came nearly two months after President [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) and his top health officials [suggested a link between autism](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-expected-link-autism-with-tylenol-experts-say-more-research-needed-2025-09-22/) and Tylenol use during pregnancy.\n\nThere is [no firm evidence](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/is-tylenol-safe-take-during-pregnancy-2025-09-22/) of such a link. Medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have said acetaminophen is the recommended first-line medication for pain and fever during pregnancy, but should be taken at the lowest possible dose.\n\nKenvue has long maintained that Tylenol is safe and does not cause autism. \"The science has not changed,\" a Kenvue spokesperson said after the hearing.\n\nCote had said the proposed expert testimony \"obscured the complexities, inconsistencies, and weaknesses in the underlying data.\"\n\nBut at Monday's hearing, Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch said the plaintiffs' primary expert, Harvard School of Public Health Dean Andrea Baccarelli, appeared to be \"explaining at every step of the way what he is doing. Even if some would disagree with each or every step he takes.\"\n\nCircuit Judge Guido Calabresi suggested that perhaps a jury could have sorted it out.\n\n\"All that matters is that people bring in evidence so that then juries or courts, this goes one way or another,\" Calabresi told Kenvue's lawyer.\n\nThe appeals court did not say when it will rule.\n\n## IMPACT ON KIMBERLY-CLARK DEAL UNCLEAR\n\nIt is unclear how reviving the lawsuits might affect Kimberly-Clark's [(KMB.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/KMB.O) plan to pay more than $40 billion to [buy Kenvue](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/kimberly-clark-acquire-kenvue-487-billion-deal-2025-11-03/), formerly part of Johnson & Johnson [(JNJ.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/JNJ.N).\n\nKimberly-Clark and Kenvue told U.S. regulators that any \"condition, development or occurrence\" related to the alleged link between Tylenol's use in pregnancy and autism and ADHD would not be a reason for Kimberly-Clark to back out. The companies plan to close the deal in 2026.\n\nKenvue has also defended against a lawsuit by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton over Tylenol.\n\nOn Friday, a Texas judge [declined Paxton's request to block](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/judge-weigh-if-texas-ag-can-block-kenvue-dividend-over-tylenol-2025-11-14/) Kenvue from paying a $398 million shareholder dividend this month, and require Kenvue to change its marketing.\n\nReporting by Diana Novak Jones; Editing by Amy Stevens, Lisa Shumaker and Bill Berkrot\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nShare\n\n- X\n\n- Facebook\n\n- Linkedin\n\n- Email\n\n- Link\n\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Diana Novak Jones](https://www.reuters.com/authors/diana-novak-jones/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nDiana reports on product liability, litigation, mass torts and the plaintiffs' bar.

Here’s what investors should know.\n\nChewy beat analysts’ revenue expectations by 0.8% last quarter, reporting revenues of $3.10 billion, up 8.6% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a narrow beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.\n\nIs Chewy a buy or sell going into earnings?

Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.30 per share.\n\n![Chewy Total Revenue](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nChewy Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Chewy has only missed Wall Street’s revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 0.8% on average.\n\nLooking at Chewy’s peers in the online retail segment, some have already reported their Q3 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Carvana delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 54.5%, beating analysts’ expectations by 11.1%, and Coupang reported revenues up 17.8%, topping estimates by 2.7%. Carvana traded down 13.8% following the results while Coupang was also down 5.9%.\n\nRead our full analysis of [Carvana’s results here](https://stockstory.org/us/stocks/nyse/cvna?utm_source=pre-earnings&utm_medium=yahoo&utm_campaign=peer&utm_article=C1l4Y24EZEY%3D&utm_ticker=CHWY) and [Coupang’s results here](https://stockstory.org/us/stocks/nyse/cpng?utm_source=pre-earnings&utm_medium=yahoo&utm_campaign=peer&utm_article=C1l4Y24EZEY%3D&utm_ticker=CHWY).\n\nInvestors in the online retail segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices up 1.6% on average over the last month. Chewy is up 2.6% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $44.81 (compared to the current share price of $34.72).\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

[CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)) stock jumped in Wednesday morning trading after the pet-focused e-commerce firm reported third-quarter results ahead of Wall Street's forecasts. Shares were up more than 2% in early trades.\n\nPlantation, Fla.-based Chewy said it earned an adjusted 32 centsper share for the Nov. 2 ended quarter **,** up 60% from a year earlier. That was ahead of the 30 cents per-share earnings analysts polled by FactSet forecast. Sales increased 8% year over year to $3.12 billion, sneaking ahead of analyst estimates of $3.1 billion.\n\n[See All Videos](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos)\n\nAfter a [two year slowdown in customers that followed pandemic-era growth,](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/chewy-stock-2025-growth-tariffs-chwy-news/) Chewy added active customers for a fourth straight quarter. Total active customers grew 5% to 21.16 million, compared to analyst estimates for 21.05 million. Active customers grew 3.8% in Chewy's fiscal Q1 and 4.5% in Q2.\n\n\"Chewy continues to outperform the pet category and expand market share, with profits once again growing faster than sales,\" Chief Executive Sumit Singh said in a [news release](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/CHWY-Q3-2025-Exhibit-99-1.pdf).\n\nFor the current quarter, Chewy guided for sales of $3.25 billion at the midpoint of its range, a hair below the $3.26 billion that analysts were forecasting for Chewy's January quarter, according to FactSet. Meanwhile, the company said it expects adjusted EPS of 24-27 cents, below the 29 cents that Wall Street was forecasting.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Dylan Carden reiterated an outperform, or buy, rating for Chewy stock in a client note that followed the company's report Wednesday morning.\n\n\"The two highlights for us here are a clearer inflection in net customer adds, up 250,000 sequentially from 150,000 last quarter, and gross margins in line with expectations, where we had been expecting some noise following the launch of the loyalty program,\" Carden wrote.\n\nHe added that the \"concern here will lie most likely in a softer guide to close the year, but we believe current period momentum should give comfort that the company can continue to meet or exceed numbers.\"\n\n## Chewy Stock: Dogged By 'Investment Year'\n\nOn the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Chewystock rallied 2.2% to 35.60 in morning trades. Shares jumped back above Chewy's [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) but remain below the 200-day line.\n\nComing into Wednesday, Chewy stock had risen 4% this year, lagging the S&P 500. The stock fell more than 16% following Chewy's Q2 results in September, which missed Wall Street's expectations for customer growth.\n\nChewy had a [strong rally to start the year](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/chewy-stock-2025-growth-tariffs-chwy-news/) but has seen those gains fade. Shares fell 18% in October.\n\nAnalysts with Morgan Stanley wrote last week that 2025 has played out as \"more of an investment year than expected,\" noting the company's focus on growing its Chewy+ rewards offering and its spending on a new fulfillment center.\n\n\"We remain bullish the medium-term revenue and profit story with a compelling valuation: The key debate on Chewy is how long does this investment period last and whether 2026 will see greater margin expansion,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Nathan Feather wrote to clients on Dec. 4.\n\nCHWY: $35.37 0.53 (1.52%) - Chewy Cl A - Investors.com\n\n110%\n\n_5-minute interval_\n\n10 msec (SVG)\n\nOne moment.

Shares were recently up 3.3% at $35.99.\n\nChief Executive Sumit Singh attributed the company’s recent momentum to efforts to strengthen its flywheel model, reinvesting its top-line gains in areas like vet offerings and a paid membership program in the hopes of boosting customer retention.\n\nSuch efforts have exceeded expectations so far, Singh said, helping both active customers and sales per active customer grow 4.9% in the quarter.\n\nCopyright ©2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In preclinical tests, Ose had shown targeting ChemR23 affects the activity of macrophages and neutrophils in ways that may accelerate the resolution of acute inflammation.\n\nAbbVie saw promise in the approach, with the pharma’s global head of discovery research Jonathon Sedgwick, Ph.D., describing ChemR23 agonism at the time as “a novel mechanism-of-action to treat chronic inflammation” and outlining plans to apply the company’s expertise in immunology to the development of OSE-230.\n\nMonday morning, Ose disclosed that the two companies had revised their agreement so that the biotech takes back responsibility for preclinical development as well as the initial phase 1 study of OSE-230, which is now called ABBV-230.\n\nOse will now be covering the costs of this initial development—which the biotech noted would be “contingent upon securing adequate funding.” The company [ended the first half of the year](https://www.ose-immuno.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EN_251015_Half-year-results-VF-1.pdf) with 25.4 million euros ($29.6 million) in the bank.\n\n### Related\n\n[Revolution via resolution: AbbVie pays $48M for OSE's preclinical chronic inflammation drug](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/revolution-resolution-abbvie-pays-48m-oses-preclinical-chronic-inflammation-drug)\n\nOnce Ose has completed the phase 1 study, AbbVie still has the rights to take up ABBV-230 to develop further and then commercialize.\n\nThe original deal saw Ose in line for $665 million in milestone payments. Today’s tweaks to the deal mean the biotech will no longer be eligible for a planned milestone payment tied to the launch of a phase 1 study. However, the milestones will continue as planned should AbbVie then decide to take ABBV-230 any further.\n\nOse framed the change to the deal in a positive light, claiming it “reflects both parties’ continued enthusiasm for the potential of ABBV-230 and aligns development responsibilities with each company’s core strengths.”\n\n“The overall value of our collaboration with AbbVie for ABBV-230 remains unchanged,” Ose CEO Marc Le Bozec said in the Dec. 8 release.\n\n“Assuming leadership of early-stage development enables OSE to accelerate progress on this innovative program while leveraging our core immunology expertise,” Le Bozec added. “The restructured agreement reflects the value we’ve built and our shared commitment to advancing transformative therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases.”\n\n[AbbVie](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/abbvie) [OSE Immunotherapeutics](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/ose-immunotherapeutics) [Licensing deals](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/licensing-deals) [inflammatory diseases](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/keyword/inflammatory-diseases) [Deals](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/deals) [Biotech](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech)"

The worry hanging over traders is that many fear a “hawkish rate cut.” Where they do cut 25 basis points, but the commentary from Chairman Powell could be hawkish, and future cuts could be moved to the sidelines.  The major indices finished mixed on Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower by 0.38% at 47,560, while the S&P 500 closed flat at 6,840. The Nasdaq put in a winning session, finishing trading at  23,576, up 0.13%.\n\n## **Treasury Bonds:**\n\n**Yields were** mixed across the Treasury curve on Tuesday as bond traders, like their equity counterparts, are laser-focused on the Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the commentary that will follow. One datapoint that will be scrutinized is the JOLTS data, which showed more job openings than were expected.  In addition, a $58 billion auction of 3-year notes saw strong demand, with yields clearing lower than expected, indicating good appetite for shorter-term debt.  The 30-year-long bond finished the session on Tuesday at 4.81%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%.\n\n## **Oil and Gas:**\n\n**Following Monday’s** poor showing, prices across the energy complex were lower for the second day in a row. The song remains the same: abundant supplies, combined with expectations of slowing demand, were the culprit once again. Sector analysts also cited that Iraq restored production at its giant West Qurna 2 oilfield after an export pipeline leak, adding about 460,000 barrels per day to global supply, about 0.5% of world output. Brent Crude was last seen at $62.05, down 0.70% while West Texas Intermediate closed at $58.35, down 0.90%. Natural gas took a beating for the second day running, closing at $4.56, down 7.21% on continued profit taking and weather-related fundamentals.\n\n[![](https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Follow-Our-500000-AI-Portfolio-3.jpg)](https://247wallst.com/ai-portfolio/2025/01/08/how-to-follow-24-7-wall-sts-500000-ai-stock-portfolio/?tc=ai-portfolio&tv=in-content-mobile&tpid=1544159)\n\n## **Gold:**\n\n**Gold and Silver** were higher on Tuesday, as rate-cut expectations provided a tailwind for the precious metals. The big story across the sector was Silver rising to a record high of $60.73 an ounce on strong industrial demand and investor interest. A real shortage of the metal boosted silver prices to record levels, as major mines faced disruptions, limiting supply. Gold was last seen on Tuesday at $4,212, up 0.56%.\n\n## **Crypto:**\n\n**Crypto trading** today on Tuesday showed a generally stable but slightly mixed market, with Bitcoin hovering around $90,000-$93,000, posting small daily gains or dips. At the same time, Ethereum and other major altcoins also experience minor fluctuations, with overall market cap figures fluctuating between $3.1 and $3.2 trillion and increased trading volume for some assets, such as Ethereum. Key themes include Bitcoin defending support near $90k and analysts watching for potential breakouts in specific altcoins, such as ADA. At 4 P.M. EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $93.130, while Ethereum was trading at $3,316.\n\n**24/7 Wall St. reviews** dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.\n\n**Here are** some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, December 10, 2025.\n\n## Upgrades\n\n- AbbVie Inc.

These shifts echo a market balancing act between enthusiasm over durable immunology growth, extended Rinvoq exclusivity, and sector rerating potential, and caution around pipeline execution risks, legacy asset softness, and macro policy uncertainty. Stay tuned to see how you can track these evolving assumptions and keep ahead of the changing story behind AbbVie’s stock.\n\n[Analyst Price Targets don't always capture the full story. Head over to our Company Report to find new ways to value AbbVie.](https://www.simplywall.st/company/id/ae62d29e-f538-406d-925c-cc036d9f8284/valuation?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_valuation_alternatives&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n## What Wall Street Has Been Saying\n\n**🐂 Bullish Takeaways**\n\n- Several firms have taken a constructive stance on AbbVie, with Scotiabank initiating at Outperform as part of an out of consensus positive view on large cap biopharma, and multiple houses, including Raymond James, Morgan Stanley, BofA, BMO Capital, Cantor Fitzgerald and Citi, lifting price targets as sentiment shifts back toward fundamentals and the next wave of innovation.\n\n- Analysts repeatedly highlight execution in core immunology as a differentiator. Morgan Stanley points to Skyrizi and Rinvoq continuing to deliver, and Raymond James calls out good Q3 outperformance driven by strong results for key growth drivers, reinforcing AbbVie’s reputation for operational follow through.\n\n- The Rinvoq patent settlements are a major driver of upgraded valuation work. BMO, Cantor Fitzgerald and Wells Fargo all emphasize that generic entry now expected in 2037 extends AbbVie’s growth runway, with Wells estimating the settlement is worth an additional $11 to $24 per share and supporting Overweight ratings and targets clustered around $240 to $245.\n\n- Broader pipeline and partnership optics also contribute to the bullish narrative. Guggenheim flags multi billion revenue potential from Epkinly, partnered with AbbVie, and H.C. Wainwright cites AbbVie’s hidradenitis suppurativa data as validating IL 1 biology and improving the risk reward for Avalo’s AVTX 009, reinforcing confidence in AbbVie’s scientific and commercial positioning.\n\n- Even where ratings remain Neutral, as at Citi and BofA, higher targets to the $240 to $251 range reflect recognition that sector policy overhangs are easing and that AbbVie’s extended exclusivity, royalty streams and immunology momentum are increasingly embedded in valuation, albeit with some upside already priced in.\n\n\nStory Continues\n\n**🐻 Bearish Takeaways**\n\n- On the more cautious side, DZ Bank, Erste Group and HSBC have all downgraded AbbVie to Hold from Buy. This signals concern that the risk reward has become more balanced after the stock’s rerating and that a significant portion of the Rinvoq and immunology upside may already be reflected in current levels.\n\n- Erste Group points specifically to a substantial guidance reduction tied to a required R&D write off, which has raised questions around pipeline execution risk and the potential for earnings volatility, even as the longer term innovation story remains intact.\n\n- Several Neutral stances, including at Citi and BofA despite notable target hikes, underline ongoing reservations around valuation and macro or policy related uncertainty. These firms acknowledge improved fundamentals but imply that near term upside could be more constrained from here.\n\n\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts? Perhaps you think there's more to the story.

This signals a strategic reset in how it approaches external early stage R&D.\n\n- DZ Bank downgraded AbbVie shares from Buy to Hold with a $237 price target, indicating that, in its view, recent stock gains already capture much of the near term upside.\n\n- AbbVie has joined a pharma consortium with Bristol Myers Squibb, Takeda and Astex to pool structural biology data to train an AI model designed to speed up drug discovery and development.\n\n- The company secured full FDA approval for EPKINLY in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. This approval was supported by Phase 3 data showing a 79% reduction in risk of disease progression or death versus standard of care. AbbVie also announced a 5.5% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $1.73 per share starting with the February 2026 payment.\n\n\n## How This Changes the Fair Value For AbbVie\n\n- Fair Value: Unchanged at approximately $243.55 per share, indicating no revision to the intrinsic value estimate.\n\n- Discount Rate: Risen slightly from about 7.28% to 7.32%, reflecting a modestly higher required return on equity.\n\n- Revenue Growth: Edged down marginally from roughly 8.13% to 8.09%, signaling a slightly more conservative top line outlook.\n\n- Net Profit Margin: Increased modestly from about 29.67% to 29.81%, implying a small uplift in expected profitability.\n\n- Future P/E: Ticked down slightly from around 23.83x to 23.77x, suggesting a marginally lower valuation multiple applied to forward earnings.\n\n\n## 🔔 Never Miss an Update: Follow The Narrative\n\nNarratives are the story behind the numbers, where investors connect their view on a company with clear forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins to arrive at a fair value. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as an accessible tool that links AbbVie’s business story to a valuation, helping them decide when to buy or sell by comparing Fair Value to the current price, with assumptions updating dynamically as news and earnings arrive.\n\nHead over to the Simply Wall St Community and follow the Narrative on AbbVie to stay on top of:\n\n- How growth in immunology and neuroscience is expected to offset losses from older, competitive drugs.\n\n- Whether AbbVie’s extended exclusivity, pipeline bets and acquisitions can sustain margins and justify a future P/E near 24x.\n\n- What could derail the story, from pricing pressure to pipeline setbacks and aesthetics weakness, and how that changes fair value versus today’s price.\n\n\nRead the original AbbVie narrative in full on Simply Wall St: [ABBV: Future Performance Will Depend On Extended Exclusivity And Pipeline Execution](https://simplywall.st/narratives/6j6gwfp8-continued-expansion-in-neuroscience-and-immunology-will-drive-leadership-beyond-2025?blueprint=4268719&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=integrated-pitch).\n\n[Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

With a 30 day share price return of 11.59% and year to date share price return of 21.51%, momentum still looks more constructive than not.\n\nIf Solventum’s move has you rethinking your exposure to the sector, it could be worth scanning other [healthcare stocks](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/7008/healthcare-sector/global?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_healthcare_screener&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4271883) that are starting to show similar strength.\n\nWith earnings growing modestly and the share price already near analyst targets, investors now face a pivotal question: Is Solventum still trading at an attractive discount, or has the market already priced in its future growth?\n\n## Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 3.2% Undervalued\n\nCompared with Solventum’s last close at $80.11, the most followed narrative sees fair value at $82.80, implying only a modest upside from here.\n\n> _Strategic portfolio optimization (including the P&F divestiture and retention of the drinking water business) along with a strong balance sheet post-transaction provide capital allocation flexibility for targeted tuck-in M&A, which can further accelerate earnings growth and improve both gross and operating margins._\n\n[Read the complete narrative.](https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/iaj7bf3g-solv-portfolio-reshaping-and-cost-controls-will-improve-outlook-for-2025?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote&utm_source=yahoo)\n\nWant to see how modest revenue growth, rising margins and a compressed future earnings multiple can still justify upside from today’s price?

A few years from now, you’ll probably wish you’d bought this stock.\n\n###### Published on November 14, 2025 at by [Inan Dogan, PhD](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/author/inandogan/)\n\nWhen Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.\n\nFast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described **generative AI** as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.\n\nAt the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by **2040** there would be **at least 10 billion humanoid robots**, with each priced between **$20,000 and $25,000**.\n\nDo the math. According to Musk, **this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.**\n\nPut another way, that’s roughly equal to:\n\n- 175 Teslas\n- 107 Amazons\n- 140 Metas\n- 84 Googles\n- 65 Microsofts\n- And 55 Nvidias\n\nAnd here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave **isn’t** tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.\n\nIt’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.\n\nEven if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.\n\n**How could anything be worth that much?**\n\nThe answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.\n\nAnd this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.\n\nWhat most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.\n\nIn fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.\n\nBefore I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.\n\n- Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.\n- Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.\n- Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.\n\nWhen billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.\n\nEven as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…\n\nBut the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.\n\nAnd judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…\n\nThis prediction might not be bold at all:\n\nA few years from now, you’ll wish you’d owned this stock.\n\nThe best part?

The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!\n\nAI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.\n\nEach ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, **AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink**.\n\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:\n\n**Where will all of that energy come from?**\n\nAI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes **as much energy as a small city**. And it’s about to get worse.\n\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:\n\n“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”\n\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\n“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”\n\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. **Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.**\n\nAnd that’s where the real opportunity lies…\n\n**One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play.** It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.\n\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\n\n**The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom**\n\n- It owns critical **nuclear energy infrastructure assets**, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.\n- It’s one of the **only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects** across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays **a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation**—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.\n\nTrump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy **American** LNG.\n\nAnd our company sits in the toll booth— **collecting fees on every drop exported.**\n\nBut that’s not all…\n\nAs Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be **first in line** to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.\n\n**AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.**\n\nWhile the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company **powering it all from behind the scenes**.\n\nAI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.\n\nAnd infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.\n\nThis company has its finger in every pie—and **Wall Street is just starting to notice**.\n\nWall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.\n\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…\n\n**This company is completely debt-free.**\n\nIn fact, it’s sitting on a **war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap**.\n\nIt also owns a **huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play**, giving investors **indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines** without paying a premium.\n\nAnd here’s what the smart money has started whispering…\n\n**The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out**\n\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that **some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits**.\n\nThey’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\n\nWhy? Because **excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings**.\n\nAnd that’s for a business tied to:\n\n- The **AI infrastructure supercycle**\n- The **onshoring boom** driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in **U.S. LNG exports**\n- And a unique footprint in **nuclear energy**—the future of clean, reliable power\n\nYou simply won’t find another AI and energy stock **this cheap**… with **this much upside**.\n\n**This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.**\n\nIt’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\n\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\n\n**Disruption is the New Name of the Game:** Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.\n\nAI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.\n\nThe companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.\n\nAs an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.\n\n**The Talent Pool is Overflowing:** The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.\n\nFrom computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.\n\nThis influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.\n\nBy investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.\n\nThe future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.\n\nDon’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.\n\nDive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.\n\nThis isn’t just about making money – it’s about being part of the future.\n\nSo, buckle up and get ready for the ride of your investment life!\n\n**Act Now and Unlock a Potential 100+% Return within 12 to 24 months.**\n\nWe’re now **offering month-to-month subscriptions with no commitments**.\n\nFor a ridiculously low price of just **$9.99 per month**, you can unlock our in-depth investment research and exclusive insights – that’s less than a single fast food meal!\n\n### Here’s why this is a deal you can’t afford to pass up:\n\n- **Access to our Detailed Report on our AI, Tariffs, and Nuclear Energy Stock with 100+% potential upside within 12 to 24 months**\n- **BONUS REPORT on our #1 AI-Robotics Stock with 10000% upside potential:** Our in-depth report dives deep into our #1 AI/robotics stock’s groundbreaking technology and massive growth potential.\n- **One New Issue of Our Premium Readership Newsletter:** You will also receive one new issue per month and at least one new stock pick per month from our monthly newsletter’s portfolio over the next 12 months.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SOLV. Solventum Corporation's share was trading at $85.59 as of December 2nd. SOLV’s trailing and forward P/E were 9.79 and 13.87  respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\n![Best Teeth Whitening Products of 2023](https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/06014913/shutterstock_512653249.jpg)\n\nSolis Images/Shutterstock.com\n\nSolventum Corporation, a healthcare company, develops, manufactures, and commercializes a portfolio of solutions to address critical customer and patient needs in the United States and internationally.  SOLV, a newly spun-off company from 3M, presents a compelling turnaround opportunity driven by low market expectations and strong leadership. The company is a leader in wound care, with rapidly growing dental bonding products and a health information system. At the time of the spin-off, Solventum appeared weak, burdened by a high debt load—D/E of 2.64 and net debt/EBITDA of 5.73—making it appear uninvestable.\n\nHowever, following the sale of its water filtration business earlier this year, the company has significantly deleveraged, bringing net debt/EBITDA down to 1.35. Management has set clear long-term targets through 2028, including 4–5% annual sales growth, 10% annual earnings growth, 80% free cash flow conversion, and margin expansion, and recent earnings indicate the company is ahead of schedule to meet these objectives.\n\nLeadership under CEO Bryan Hanson, formerly of Zimmer Biomet, is a key catalyst, as he specializes in operational turnarounds, supply chain optimization, and regulatory compliance in healthcare. Valuation remains attractive due to pessimistic market sentiment. Using conservative assumptions, such as a flat 2025 EPS of $6, the stock’s price floor is around $66–67.\n\nAccounting for modest terminal growth of 3%, fair value rises to $80, and with a conservative 5% growth over five years, net present value could reach $112. The stock’s current price of $71.79 reflects low expectations and a “show me” mentality from analysts, with market-implied valuations from Morningstar and CFRA at $79.\n\nKey risks include potential litigation related to PFAS in certain wound-care products sold post-2026, though the company appears aware and positioned to manage these exposures. Overall, Solventum offers a classic slow-and-steady turnaround investment with strong leadership, deleveraged finances, and visible growth targets, providing an attractive risk-reward profile for patient investors.\n\nPreviously we covered a [**bullish thesis**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/lantheus-holdings-inc-lnth-a-bull-case-theory-2-1423413/) on Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH) by Oliver \\| MMMT Wealth in January 2025, which highlighted its leadership in radiopharmaceuticals and growth in PSMA PET imaging. The stock has depreciated approximately 38.14% since our coverage due to market challenges. The thesis still stands as LNTH retains innovation potential. Raytoei shares a similar approach but emphasizes Solventum’s turnaround, deleveraging, and steady growth post-spin-off.\n\nSolventum Corporation is not on our list of the [**30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/30-most-popular-stocks-among-hedge-funds-2024-q3-1415561/). As per our database, 37 hedge fund portfolios held SOLV at the end of the second quarter which was 38 in the previous quarter.While we acknowledge the potential of SOLV as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing _return_ on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding _base_ of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in **Howmet Aerospace's** ( [NYSE:HWM](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/quote/HWM)) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\n[Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global?blueprint=4267862&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=investing-ideas&utm_source=yahoo&utm_content=us-oil-gas-pipeline-operators)\n\n## What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Howmet Aerospace, this is the formula:\n\n**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**\n\n0.21 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$11b - US$1.6b) _(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025)_.\n\nSo, **Howmet Aerospace has an ROCE of 21%.** In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace & Defense industry average of 11%.\n\n[Check out our latest analysis for Howmet Aerospace](https://simplywall.st/company/id/65B0410B-6333-4511-B091-B01909A65962?blueprint=4267862&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n[![roce](<Base64-Image-Removed>)](https://simplywall.st/company/id/65B0410B-6333-4511-B091-B01909A65962?blueprint=4267862&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo)\n\nNYSE:HWM Return on Capital Employed December 8th 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Howmet Aerospace compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our **free** [analyst report for Howmet Aerospace](https://simplywall.st/company/id/65B0410B-6333-4511-B091-B01909A65962/future?blueprint=4267862&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion&utm_source=yahoo).\n\n## How Are Returns Trending?\n\nHowmet Aerospace's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 125% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.\n\n## The Key Takeaway\n\nTo sum it up, Howmet Aerospace is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And a remarkable 622% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Howmet Aerospace can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nLike most companies, Howmet Aerospace does come with some risks, and we've found [**1 warning sign**](https://simplywall.st/company/id/65B0410B-6333-4511-B091-B01909A65962?blueprint=4267862&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion-grid&utm_source=yahoo) that you should be aware of.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this **free** [list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global?blueprint=4267862&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion-grid&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n**Have feedback on this article?

News\n\nTucson, AZ – The members of the Tucson Anti War Committee (TAWC) joined in the national campaign against Howmet Aerospace. Howmet is a manufacturer of parts for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet. F-35s purchased by Israel are used in the genocidal war against Gaza and recently missile strikes in the West Bank.\n\nIn the fall, BDS Pittsburgh initiated outreach to the anti-war groups affiliated with the Anti-War Action Network that have Howmet facilities in their cities. So far, Cleveland United Against War, the Minnesota Anti-War Committee and TAWC, have joined other cities in the campaign against Howmet.\n\nTAWC hosted a community teach-in at Revolutionary Grounds bookstore and coffee shop on December 6. The presentation gave information on the connections between the state of Arizona and Zionist Israel. People heard about the dozens of companies that contract with Israel and Israeli companies, state-held bonds of $15 million, multiple AIPAC-funded state representatives like Alma Hernandez, and about Howmet Aerospace’s contract with Lockheed Martin.\n\n17% of Howmet Aerospace’s business is making parts for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet.\n\nTAWC organizer Maria Sohn Hasman stated, “We have and should continue to hold protests and marches to denounce Israel’s continued genocide of Gaza and attacks on the West Bank and elsewhere in occupied Palestine. But this campaign presents an opportunity to stop production of the F-35 and deal a material blow to the Zionist regime and U.S. imperialism.”\n\nNext steps for the campaign are outreach and flyering to raise awareness and build a mass movement locally and nationally to get Howmet to cut ties with genocide.\n\n[#TucsonAZ](https://fightbacknews.org/tag:TucsonAZ) [#AntiWarMovement](https://fightbacknews.org/tag:AntiWarMovement) [#TAWC](https://fightbacknews.org/tag:TAWC) [#Palestine](https://fightbacknews.org/tag:Palestine)\n\nShare to:\n\n[Facebook](https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://fightbacknews.org/articles/tucson-anti-war-committee-launches-campaign-against-howmet-aerospace) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Tucson,%20AZ%20-%20The%20members%20of%20the%20Tucson%20Anti%20War%20Committee%20(TAWC)%20joined%20in%20the%20national%20campaign%20against%20Howmet%20Aerospace.%20Howmet%20is%20a%20...&url=https://fightbacknews.org/articles/tucson-anti-war-committee-launches-campaign-against-howmet-aerospace) [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/widgets/share/tool?posttype=link&title=Tucson,%20AZ%20-%20The%20members%20of%20the%20Tucson%20Anti%20War%20Committee%20(TAWC)%20joined%20in%20the%20national%20campaign%20against%20Howmet%20Aerospace.%20Howmet%20is%20a%20...&caption=Tucson,%20AZ%20-%20The%20members%20of%20the%20Tucson%20Anti%20War%20Committee%20(TAWC)%20joined%20in%20the%20national%20campaign%20against%20Howmet%20Aerospace.%20Howmet%20is%20a%20...&content=https://fightbacknews.org/articles/tucson-anti-war-committee-launches-campaign-against-howmet-aerospace&canonicalUrl=https://fightbacknews.org/articles/tucson-anti-war-committee-launches-campaign-against-howmet-aerospace&shareSource=tumblr_share_button) [E-Mail](mailto:?subject=Tucson,%20AZ%20-%20The%20members%20of%20the%20Tucson%20Anti%20War%20Committee%20(TAWC)%20joined%20in%20the%20national%20campaign%20against%20Howmet%20Aerospace.%20Howmet%20is%20a%20...&body=https://fightbacknews.org/articles/tucson-anti-war-committee-launches-campaign-against-howmet-aerospace) [Reddit](https://reddit.com/submit/?url=https://fightbacknews.org/articles/tucson-anti-war-committee-launches-campaign-against-howmet-aerospace&resubmit=true&title=Tucson,%20AZ%20-%20The%20members%20of%20the%20Tucson%20Anti%20War%20Committee%20(TAWC)%20joined%20in%20the%20national%20campaign%20against%20Howmet%20Aerospace.%20Howmet%20is%20a%20...)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n\nreCAPTCHA"

    "content": "Howmet Aerospace (HWM) just delivered upbeat quarterly results, with revenue and earnings per share climbing solidly year over year. The stock has been quietly outpacing the broader Dow over the past three months.\n\n[See our latest analysis for Howmet Aerospace.](https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-hwm/howmet-aerospace?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_company_latest_analysis)\n\nEven after a recent pullback, with a 30 day share price return of negative 7.6 percent and a 7 day decline, Howmet’s year to date share price surge above 70 percent and five year total shareholder return above 600 percent signal powerful, still intact momentum.\n\nIf this kind of outperformance has your attention, it is worth seeing which other names in the sector are gaining traction through [aerospace and defense stocks](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/2376/aerospace-and-defense/global?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_aersospace_and_defense_screener).\n\nWith earnings growth accelerating, a strong multiyear run behind it, and analyst targets still implying upside, investors now face a key question: Is Howmet still misunderstood by the market, or is future growth already fully priced in?\n\n## Most Popular Narrative: 17.7% Undervalued\n\nWith Howmet Aerospace last closing at $190.98 against an implied fair value near $232, the prevailing narrative leans toward meaningful upside still ahead.\n\n_Strategic investments in automation and digital manufacturing, combined with cost rationalization and product mix optimization, are driving underlying productivity improvements and gross margin expansion, supporting robust long-term earnings growth._\n\n[Read the complete narrative.](https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/l6luwmr8-analysts-raise-howmet-aerospace-price-target-as-margin-expansion-drives-renewed-optimism?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote)\n\nWant to see what kind of revenue runway and margin lift could justify this premium earnings multiple on a capital intensive manufacturer? The most followed narrative lays out an aggressive path for top line growth, expanding profitability, and shrinking share count that aims to support a valuation framework usually reserved for faster growing sectors. Curious which specific earnings and revenue milestones this view depends on, and how long the market is expected to pay up for that trajectory? Explore the full narrative to unpack the assumptions driving this fair value call.\n\n**Result: Fair Value of $232.15 (UNDERVALUED)**\n\n[Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.](https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/l6luwmr8-analysts-raise-howmet-aerospace-price-target-as-margin-expansion-drives-renewed-optimism?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_ai_narrative)\n\nHowever, this optimistic path could be challenged if aerospace build rates stumble or major OEM customers renegotiate contracts, which could pressure margins and earnings visibility.\n\n[Find out about the key risks to this Howmet Aerospace narrative.](https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-hwm/howmet-aerospace?bpId=4268193&link_type=risks_narrative_cta)\n\n## Another Lens on Valuation\n\nWhile the narrative model suggests upside, a simple earnings multiple tells a tougher story. At roughly 53 times earnings versus 37 times for the US Aerospace and Defense group and 26.7 times for peers, and above a fair ratio of 35.1 times, Howmet already bakes in a lot of perfection. This leaves investors to ask how much future surprise is really left.\n\n[See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.](https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-hwm/howmet-aerospace/valuation?bpId=4268193&link_type=alternate_preferred_multiple_cta)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg height=\"476px\" width=\"746px\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\"/>)![NYSE:HWM PE Ratio as at Dec 2025](https://images.simplywall.st/company/65b0410b-6333-4511-b091-b01909a65962/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry)](https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-hwm/howmet-aerospace/valuation?bpId=4268193&link_type=infographic) NYSE:HWM PE Ratio as at Dec 2025\n\n## Build Your Own Howmet Aerospace Narrative\n\nIf you see the story differently or want to dig into the numbers yourself, you can build a personalized view in just a few minutes: [Do it your way](https://support.simplywall.st/hc/en-us/articles/10353275550479-Stock-Valuator-with-Narratives?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_create_narrative).\n\nA great starting point for your Howmet Aerospace research is our analysis highlighting [3 key rewards and 1 important warning sign](https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-hwm/howmet-aerospace?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_risks_rewards_analysis) that could impact your investment decision.\n\n## Ready for your next investing edge?\n\nBefore you move on, lock in a few high potential ideas from the Simply Wall St Screener so you are not relying on just one winning story.\n\n- Capture mispriced opportunities by targeting companies flagged as undervalued using [these 903 undervalued stocks based on cash flows](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows/global?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_screener_undervalued) before the rest of the market catches on.\n- Position yourself for structural growth by focusing on innovation leaders highlighted in [these 26 AI penny stocks](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434414/ai-penny-stocks/global?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_screener_ai_stocks) at the heart of the AI transformation.\n- Boost your potential income stream by zeroing in on reliable payers surfaced through [these 15 dividend stocks with yields > 3%](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/146/dividend-powerhouses-3-yield/global?bpId=4268193&link_type=cta_screener_dividend) while yields remain attractive.\n\n_This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. **We provide commentary based on historical data**_\n_**and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.** It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your_\n_financial situation.

( [HWM](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/HWM/overview)) provides advanced engineered solutions for the aerospace and transportation industries. Valued at [$78.9 billion](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/HWM/profile) by market cap, Howmet focuses on manufacturing jet engine components, aerospace fastening systems, titanium structural parts necessary for mission-critical performance and efficiency in aerospace and defense applications, and forged wheels for commercial transportation.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally classified as “large-cap stocks.” HWM fits right into that category, reflecting its substantial size, dominance, and influence in the industrial sector.\n\nHowmet stock touched its [all-time high of $211.95](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/hwm/price-history/historical) on Oct. 30 and is currently 7.4% below that peak. HWM stock prices have [gained 9.3%](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/HWM/performance) over the past three months, outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s ( [$DOWI](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$dowi/overview)) [4.9% gains](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$dowi/performance) during the same time frame.\n\n![](https://barchart-news-media-prod.aws.barchart.com/SANDP/0aa7e0c64140429e2afe1a97852c2d84/z7e2ec4t5vszzgnb.png)[www.barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/hwm/interactive-chart)\n\nHowmet Aerospace’s performance has remained impressive over the longer term as well. HWM stock prices have surged 79.5% on a YTD basis and 63.4% over the past 52 weeks, compared to the Dow’s 12.5% gains in 2025 and 6.3% returns over the past year.\n\nMeanwhile, HWM stock has traded consistently above its 200-day moving average and mostly above its 50-day moving average over the past year, with some fluctuations, underscoring its bullish trend.\n\n![](https://barchart-news-media-prod.aws.barchart.com/SANDP/0aa7e0c64140429e2afe1a97852c2d84/niygl4kerajehppr.png)[www.barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/hwm/interactive-chart)\n\nDespite reporting better-than-expected results, Howmet Aerospace’s stock prices observed a [marginal dip](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/hwm/price-history/historical) in the trading session following the release of its [Q3 results](https://www.howmet.com/press-release/2025-10-30/howmet-aerospace-reports-third-quarter-2025-results/) on Oct. 30. Driven by constant high demand for its products, HWM’s revenues for the quarter soared 13.8% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, beating the Street’s expectations by 2.1%. Meanwhile, its EPS grew 17.3% year-over-year to $0.95, exceeding the [consensus estimates](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/hwm/earnings-estimates) by 4.4%. Following the initial dip, HWM stock maintained a positive momentum for two subsequent trading sessions.\n\nFurther, Howmet has significantly outperformed its peer, Northrop Grumman Corporation’s ( [NOC](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/noc/overview)) [17.8% surge](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/noc/performance) in 2025 and 13.6% returns over the past year.\n\nAmong the 22 analysts covering the HWM stock, the consensus rating is a “ [Strong Buy](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/hwm/analyst-ratings).” Its mean price target of $231.28 suggests a 17.8% upside potential from current price levels.\n\n_On the date of publication, [Aditya Sarawgi](https://www.barchart.com/news/authors/419/aditya-sarawgi) did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The dividend will be payable on February 13, 2026, to shareholders of record as of January 21, 2026.\n\nThe consumer products company highlighted in its press release statement that it has maintained uninterrupted dividend payments on its common stock since 1895, marking over 130 years of consistent shareholder returns. According to [InvestingPro](https://www.investing.com/pro/CL) data, Colgate-Palmolive has not only maintained dividends for 55 consecutive years but has raised them for 36 consecutive years, demonstrating exceptional commitment to shareholder value.\n\nColgate-Palmolive operates in the oral care, personal care, home care, and pet nutrition segments, with products sold in more than 200 countries and territories. The company’s brand portfolio includes Colgate, Palmolive, elmex, Ajax, and Hill’s Science Diet, among others.\n\nThe dividend announcement comes as part of the company’s regular quarterly financial activities. Colgate-Palmolive’s consistent dividend history represents one of the longest uninterrupted payment records among publicly traded companies. Currently trading at $77.75, near its 52-week low of $74.55, the stock appears undervalued according to [InvestingPro](https://www.investing.com/pro/CL) Fair Value estimates. With a market cap of $62.57 billion and a P/E ratio of 21.74, investors can access comprehensive analysis in the Pro Research Report, available with over 10 additional ProTips and extensive financial metrics on [InvestingPro](https://www.investing.com/pro/CL).\n\nIn other recent news, Colgate-Palmolive reported an increase in net sales and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2025. Despite challenges from raw material inflation and foreign exchange impacts, the company confirmed its guidance for low single-digit EPS growth for the year. Adding to the positive developments, RBC Capital upgraded Colgate-Palmolive’s stock from Sector Perform to Outperform, maintaining a price target of $88. This upgrade followed a period where the company faced pressure due to slowing global category growth, which ended a streak of 24 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth within its long-term algorithm of 3-5%. These recent developments highlight the company’s resilience and strategic positioning in the current market environment.\n\n3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com.

The forward yield stands at 2.67%. This dividend is scheduled for payment on February 13, with a record date of January 21 and an ex-dividend date also on January 21. Investors can refer to the CL Dividend Scorecard, Yield Chart, and Dividend Growth for more insights.\n\nFounded in 1806, Colgate-Palmolive has evolved into a leading entity in the household and personal care industry. The company is renowned for its oral care line, which constitutes over 40% of its total sales. Additionally, Colgate-Palmolive manufactures a variety of personal and home care products, as well as specialty pet food under the Hill's brand. With a significant international presence, approximately 70% of its business is derived from global markets, including 45% from emerging regions. The company operates within the Consumer Defensive sector and the Consumer Packaged Goods industry, boasting a market capitalization of $62.68 billion.\n\n## Financial Health Analysis\n\nColgate-Palmolive's financial performance is underscored by its consistent revenue growth and robust profitability metrics:\n\n- [Revenue](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/revenue/CL) for the trailing twelve months stands at $20.097 billion, with a 3-year growth rate of 5.9%.\n- The company maintains a strong [gross margin](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/gross-margin/CL) of 60.14%, reflecting efficient cost management.\n- [Net margin](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/net-margin/CL) is at 14.47%, indicating solid profitability.\n- Operating margin has seen a decline over the past five years, averaging a decrease of 2.2% annually.\n\nOn the balance sheet front, Colgate-Palmolive exhibits financial resilience:\n\n- The [current ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/current-ratio/CL) is 0.93, and the [quick ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/quick-ratio/CL) is 0.6, indicating adequate liquidity to cover short-term liabilities.\n- The [debt-to-equity ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/debt-to-equity/CL) is 9.84, suggesting a high level of leverage, which is typical for companies in this sector.\n- Colgate-Palmolive's [return on equity](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/roe/CL) is an impressive 566%, highlighting exceptional efficiency in generating returns on shareholder investments.\n\nDespite these strengths, there are warning signs to consider:\n\n- The [Altman Z-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/zscore/CL) of 6.36 indicates strong financial health, reducing the risk of bankruptcy.\n- Insider activity shows some selling, with 1,237 shares sold in the past three months, which could be a point of concern for investors.\n\n## Valuation & Market Sentiment\n\nColgate-Palmolive's valuation metrics suggest the stock is trading near historical lows, potentially offering an attractive entry point:\n\n- The [P/E ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pe-ratio/CL) is 21.78, close to its 10-year low.\n- The [P/S ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/CL) is 3.16, also near its 10-year low.\n- The [P/B ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pb-ratio/CL) stands at 73.36, reflecting a valuation close to historical lows.\n\nAnalyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with a target price of $87.08 and a recommendation score of 2.5, indicating a moderate buy.\n\nTechnical indicators provide additional insights:\n\n- The [RSI (14)](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rsi-14/CL) is 43.19, suggesting the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.\n- Moving averages indicate a downward trend, with the 20-day SMA at 78.82 and the 200-day SMA at 86.24.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nColgate-Palmolive's financial health is robust, as evidenced by its strong [Altman Z-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/zscore/CL) and [Beneish M-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/mscore/CL) of -2.66, indicating a low likelihood of financial manipulation.\n\nHowever, sector-specific risks, such as changes in consumer preferences and competitive pressures, remain pertinent. The company's [beta](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/beta/CL) of 0.14 suggests low volatility relative to the market, providing some stability in turbulent times.\n\nIn conclusion, while Colgate-Palmolive faces certain challenges, its strong financial foundation and attractive valuation metrics make it a noteworthy consideration for investors seeking stability and consistent returns in the consumer defensive sector.\n\n**Also check out: ( [Free Trial](https://www.gurufocus.com/membership/upgrade.php?ref=news-end))**\n\n- [High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio](https://www.gurufocus.com/dividend-stocks.php)\n- [Top dividend stocks of Warren Buffett](https://www.gurufocus.com/holdings.php?GuruName=Warren+Buffett&tab=yield)\n- [Top dividend stocks of George Soros](https://www.gurufocus.com/holdings.php?GuruName=George+Soros&tab=yield)\n\n_This stock alert was generated using automated technology and GuruFocus financial data to provide readers with timely and accurate market reporting.

The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Colgate-Palmolive Investment Narrative Recap\n\nTo own Colgate-Palmolive, you have to believe its global oral care and pet nutrition franchises can keep converting brand strength and pricing power into steady cash generation, even as volumes and input costs fluctuate. RBC’s upgrade, rooted in confidence around earnings resilience and free cash flow, supports that view but does not materially change the key near term catalyst, which remains category and volume stabilization, or the biggest risk, which is ongoing pressure from raw material and packaging costs.\n\nAmong recent company announcements, the ongoing share repurchase program, with roughly US$515.8 million spent to retire about 0.73% of shares since March 2025, is especially relevant in light of RBC’s focus on free cash flow. It reinforces the idea that Colgate-Palmolive’s cash generation can both support reinvestment in innovation and digital initiatives and fund capital returns, which may help offset softer organic sales guidance while investors wait for demand and category trends to firm up.\n\nBut against this backdrop of strong margins and cash returns, investors should be aware of the risk that rising palm oil and packaging costs could...\n\n[Read the full narrative on Colgate-Palmolive (it's free!)](https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/household/nyse-cl/colgate-palmolive/a7tksu28-cl-future-cost-optimization-will-drive-competitive-advantage-amid-category-headwinds)\n\nColgate-Palmolive's narrative projects $22.4 billion revenue and $3.5 billion earnings by 2028.

That legacy is alive, with families creating new memories where the game began. TheMGM Springfield Basketball Hall of Fame Classic took place Wednesday night at the MassMutual Center in Springfield.\n\nThere was a lot of liveliness here at the MassMutual Center, all eyes are on the hardwood here in downtown Springfield, as Wednesday marked the opening day of the Hall of Fame Classic.\n\nCollege hoops fans from all over made their way to downtown Springfield for a couple of regional matchups. University of Albany tipped off against Yale at 4:30 p.m. and then for the next match up, UMass Amherst is set to face off against the Boston College Eagles at 7 p.m.\n\nThis is the first time they’ll meet on the court in 11 years, when UMass beat Boston College at TD Garden. For UMass and BC fans, isn’t just a game, it’s bragging rights for possibly the next 11 years.\n\nRight now, the Minutemen have a 3-game winning-streak against the Eagles. However, one Boston College alumni, Andrew Nicholson, traveled all the way from Albany, New York to see his alma mater face off against UMass right here in the birthplace of basketball and he’s hopeful Boston College will take the win.\n\n“This is a great event. I mean, like, yeah, Springfield’s the first place in basketball, right? So, like, it’s cool, especially, like, to have teams from the region. And, like, hopefully, you know, like, I walked by, there was, like, a father and son here. And, like, I overheard the dad. It’s nice to just have basketball in the state of Massachusetts, like, bringing it back to its roots And, yeah, I hope there’s a lot of, like, kids here tonight, you know?” said Nicholson.\n\nIsn’t just about who wins or loses, it’s about keeping basketball’s legacy alive, right where it all began.\n\n_Copyright 2025.

Former financial institutions head Tom Dilley becomes global head of client engagement, while Danny Clack, deputy active underwriter of Mosaic Syndicate 1609, has been appointed head of broker engagement, international; both will report to global engagement officer Yosha DeLong while continuing in underwriting roles.\n\n**Read more:** [Mosaic advisory board appointments](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/insurance-moves-alliant-aspen-mosaic-543042.aspx)\n\nWarty joins Mosaic from [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/berkshire-hathaway/535041/) Specialty Insurance, where he co-led the US financial institutions business for the past five years after previously serving as a lead underwriter for financial institutions across the US Central and Western regions. Earlier in his career, he held underwriting positions at [CNA](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/cna/66999/) and [Travelers](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/travelers/67047/).\n\nEarlier in the year, Mosaic also announced the expansion of its advisory board, adding three new members with backgrounds in insurance, cybersecurity, and private equity.\n\n## **Lockton marine risks and liability practice leader**\n\nIn the brokerage segment, Lockton has appointed Jake Byrne (pictured above, right) as US marine risks and liability practice leader, a role focused on overseeing the broker’s marine practice strategy and service to clients across the country. Lockton said Byrne’s appointment reflects its effort to deepen marine expertise for US and international clients.\n\nSince joining Lockton in 2020, Byrne has worked in a dual capacity for Lockton’s global marine practice and as a representative of Lockton P.L. Ferrari, which the firm describes as the oldest and largest specialist protection and indemnity broker in marine insurance.\n\nIn his new position, Byrne will be responsible for driving marine strategy across Lockton’s US operations, including enhancing client service, making targeted investments to support growth and expanding the firm’s presence in the marine sector. He succeeds Jana Byron, a longtime Lockton leader and maritime law specialist who died unexpectedly in August.\n\n**Read more:** [Lockton appoints new leaders in US casualty](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/lockton-appoints-new-leaders-in-us-casualty-548823.aspx)\n\nBefore joining Lockton, Byrne spent nearly nine years at [Aon](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/aon/219421/), concentrating on complex international marine accounts such as cruise lines, shipping companies, charities, commodity brokers and mega yachts. He holds an MBA in finance and marketing and a bachelor’s degree in finance from the University of Miami and is based in Tampa, Fla.\n\nIn September, the broker also announced new leadership appointments within its US casualty business, naming Peter Rapciewicz as US casualty leader and Jessica Cullen as head of excess casualty and operations.\n\n## **Westfield enterprise CIO**\n\n![](https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/003/0356_639008912969864755.jpg)\n\nOn the carrier technology front, Westfield has named Lloyd Scholz (pictured immediately above) as enterprise chief information officer (CIO), a newly created role that will report directly to CEO and board chair Ed Largent. Scholz will oversee the development and execution of a business-driven technology strategy to support Westfield’s growth, diversification and global expansion.\n\nHis remit includes advancing technology, data and analytics capabilities across Westfield’s global property and casualty operations. The company said the new enterprise CIO position and Scholz’s appointment are intended to strengthen its technology leadership as it expands its presence in the global P&C market.\n\nScholz joins Westfield with more than 25 years of technology leadership experience in financial services and insurance. Most recently, he served as senior managing director and chief technology officer at Markel, leading global technology teams across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.\n\nPrior to that, he spent 16 years at Capital One in a series of leadership roles focused on data engineering, analytics platforms, cloud strategy and enterprise technology transformation.\n\n## **MassMutual board director**\n\nIn a separate governance-related move, MassMutual has appointed Michael T. Rollings to its board of directors.

MassMutual will remain Barings’ majority owner with an 82% stake and controlling governance rights and Barings will also continue to manage the majority of MassMutual’s general investment account and remain core to the company’s asset management strategy. Barings will continue to operate as an independent subsidiary of MassMutual with no changes to its day-to-day operations, investment committees, processes, or strategy.\n\nAs part of the strategic partnership, MS&AD will provide growth capital to support Barings in achieving its long-term growth strategy. In addition, Barings will expand its existing relationship with MS&AD through the management of assets within MS&AD’s general investment account, helping to strengthen and diversify MS&AD’s investment portfolio and giving it greater access to Barings’ global public and private markets capabilities. A member of MS&AD’s leadership team will also join Barings’ Board of Managers.\n\n“At MassMutual, one of our distinct competitive advantages to deliver sustained value to our policyowners has long been our diverse portfolio of strategic businesses and investments, of which Barings plays a key role. This investment by MS&AD creates a strategic partnership with a leading global insurance company that is also deeply committed to Barings’ long-term success. The transaction accelerates Barings’ growth and builds on our long-standing, successful optimization of the intersection of insurance and asset management, allowing us to realize even more value over time and ultimately benefiting our policyowners and customers.” – Roger Crandall, Chairman, President and CEO of MassMutual.\n\n“We are excited to partner with MS&AD and believe this is a unique opportunity to accelerate Barings’ growth. Building on MassMutual’s continued support, Barings will combine growth capital with our scale and expertise in public and private markets to drive our long-term strategy and deliver solutions for clients.” – Mike Freno, Chairman and CEO of Barings.\n\n“We are pleased to have the opportunity to invest in Barings. Forming a new strategic partnership with Barings—an asset manager with a strong track record and deep expertise—and with MassMutual, a leading provider of high-quality life insurance solutions, carries significant meaning for our group. We are confident that supporting Barings’ sustainable, long-term growth in close collaboration with MassMutual will create lasting value for all three firms.” – Shinichiro Funabiki, President & CEO of MS&AD and MSI.\n\n#### Share this\n\n[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoverager.com%2Fmsad-to-acquire-stake-in-barings-from-massmutual%2F&via=coverager \"Share on X\") [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcoverager.com%2Fmsad-to-acquire-stake-in-barings-from-massmutual%2F \"Share on Facebook\") [Share on Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoverager.com%2Fmsad-to-acquire-stake-in-barings-from-massmutual%2F \"Share on Linkedin\") [Share via Email](mailto:?subject=Coverager&body=https%3A%2F%2Fcoverager.com%2Fmsad-to-acquire-stake-in-barings-from-massmutual%2F \"Share via Email\")\n\n#### **Get Coverager to your inbox**\n\nA really good email covering top news.\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\nRelated Posts\n\n![image](https://coverager.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/wrberkleycorporation_logo.jpg)\n\n[Business](https://coverager.com/category/business)\n\n### [Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance acquires 12.5% stake in W.

(NYSE:CYH) announced Wednesday the appointment of Kevin Hammons as chief executive officer and Jason Johnson as chief financial officer, effective immediately. Both executives had been serving in these roles on an interim basis since October 1, 2025. The leadership change comes as the company maintains a solid financial footing with a P/E ratio of just 1.38 and has been deemed undervalued according to [InvestingPro](https://www.investing.com/pro/CYH) analysis.\n\nHammons, who previously served as the company’s chief financial officer since January 2020, has also been appointed to the Board of Directors. He joined Community Health Systems in 1997 and has held various financial leadership positions, including chief accounting officer, assistant chief financial officer, and treasurer.\n\nJohnson, the new CFO, previously served as chief accounting officer, overseeing the company’s SEC reporting and other accounting responsibilities. He joined CHS in 2012 as vice president and assistant corporate controller.\n\n\"I’m honored to lead the CHS team during a time when we see significant opportunities to advance clinical services, quality and patient care,\" Hammons said in a press release statement.\n\nWayne T. Smith, chairman of the Board of Directors, expressed confidence in the appointments, noting both executives’ \"deep understanding of our company and the healthcare industry.\"\n\nCommunity Health Systems operates 69 affiliated hospitals with more than 10,000 beds across 14 states. The company also manages over 1,000 sites of care, including physician practices, urgent care centers, and ambulatory surgery centers.\n\nThe healthcare provider is headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee, and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CYH.\n\nIn other recent news, Community Health Systems reported impressive third-quarter earnings for 2025, with revenue reaching $3.09 billion, surpassing the forecast of $2.99 billion. The company’s earnings per share also exceeded expectations, coming in at $0.96 compared to the anticipated -$0.24. Additionally, Community Health Systems completed the sale of select ambulatory outreach laboratory services to Labcorp for approximately $194 million in cash. The company has also entered into an agreement to sell its 80% ownership stake in Tennova Healthcare-Clarksville to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for $600 million, pending adjustments. Furthermore, Community Health Systems plans to sell three Pennsylvania hospitals to affiliates of Tenor Health Foundation. Truist Securities responded to these developments by raising its price target for Community Health to $4.50 from $3.25, maintaining a Hold rating. The price target increase follows the company’s better-than-expected third-quarter results and a one-time legal settlement.\n\n_This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Think of the CEO as the captain of a ship, steering it toward success. Investors pay close attention to the CEO because their leadership and strategy can significantly influence the company's performance and future growth.\n\nchief financial officerfinancial\n\nA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is the person in charge of a company's money and financial planning. They decide how to spend, save, and invest funds to help the company grow and stay stable. Their role is important because good financial decisions keep the company healthy and successful.\n\nchief accounting officerfinancial\n\nA chief accounting officer is a senior executive responsible for overseeing a company's financial records and ensuring all accounting practices are accurate and compliant with regulations. They play a key role in preparing financial reports that help investors understand the company's financial health, much like a trusted navigator guiding a ship through complex waters. Their work ensures transparency and trust in the company's financial information.\n\nenterprise resource planning (ERP)technical\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) is a type of software that helps a business organize and manage its core activities—such as finance, supply chain, manufacturing, and human resources—within a unified system. It acts like a central hub that brings together different parts of a company, making operations more efficient and providing better data for decision-making. For investors, ERP systems can signal how well a company integrates and manages its resources, impacting overall performance and growth prospects.\n\nSEC reportingregulatory\n\nSEC reporting is the process by which publicly traded companies regularly share important financial information with the government agency responsible for overseeing the stock market. This information helps investors understand a company's financial health and make informed decisions, much like how a doctor’s check-up provides insight into a person's well-being. Consistent and transparent reporting ensures trust and fairness in the financial markets.\n\ncapital market transactionsfinancial\n\nCapital market transactions are the actions a company takes to raise money from investors by selling new shares, bonds, or other long-term securities to the public or institutions. For investors, these deals change who owns the company and how it is financed—similar to a household taking out a mortgage or selling stock to raise cash—which can dilute share value, alter risk, and affect future returns.\n\ntreasury managementfinancial\n\nTreasury management is a company's day‑to‑day handling of cash, short‑term investments, borrowing and financial risks to make sure bills are paid, excess cash is used wisely, and exposure to things like interest rates or foreign currencies is controlled. Think of it as running the company's checking account and emergency fund so operations keep flowing. For investors, strong treasury management signals that a company can meet obligations, fund growth without costly surprises, and protect value in changing markets.\n\ninvestor relationsfinancial\n\nInvestor relations is the communication process between a company and its current or potential investors. It involves sharing information about the company's performance, strategies, and outlook to help investors make informed decisions. Effective investor relations build trust and transparency, similar to a clear conversation between a business and someone considering investing, ensuring both parties understand each other's interests and expectations.\n\n[![Share on X](https://static.stocktitan.net/img/icons/x-icon.png)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%24CYH%20Community%20Health%20Systems%20Appoints%20Kevin%20Hammons%20Chief%20Executive%20Officer%20and%20Jason%20Johnson%20Chief%20Financial%20Officer%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.stocktitan.net%2Fnews%2FCYH%2Fcommunity-health-systems-appoints-kevin-hammons-chief-executive-fvytke3v4oe4.html \"Share on X\")[![Share on Reddit](https://static.stocktitan.net/img/icons/reddit-icon.png)](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stocktitan.net%2Fnews%2FCYH%2Fcommunity-health-systems-appoints-kevin-hammons-chief-executive-fvytke3v4oe4.html&title=Community%20Health%20Systems%20Appoints%20Kevin%20Hammons%20Chief%20Executive%20Officer%20and%20Jason%20Johnson%20Chief%20Financial%20Officer \"Share on Reddit\")[![Share on Facebook](https://static.stocktitan.net/img/icons/facebook-icon.png)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stocktitan.net%2Fnews%2FCYH%2Fcommunity-health-systems-appoints-kevin-hammons-chief-executive-fvytke3v4oe4.html&quote=%24CYH%20%7C%20Community%20Health%20Systems%20Appoints%20Kevin%20Hammons%20Chief%20Executive%20Officer%20and%20Jason%20Johnson%20Chief%20Financial%20Officer \"Share on Facebook\")[![Copy link](https://static.stocktitan.net/img/icons/link-icon.png)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CYH/community-health-systems-appoints-kevin-hammons-chief-executive-fvytke3v4oe4.html# \"Copy link\")\n\n12/10/2025 - 04:15 PM\n\n\nFRANKLIN, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nCommunity Health Systems, Inc.

That’s a sharp contrast to the broader industry, which is up nearly 30% over the same stretch. The pullback occurred amid a familiar mix of pressure points: heavy leverage, uneven patient demand, thin profitability and heightened investor anxiety around hospital-sector risks.\n\n![Zacks Investment Research](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIronically, CYH delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent memory. It posted earnings of $1.27 per share last quarter, topping the consensus estimate of a loss of 32 cents, helped by lower expenses and a healthier payor mix. Still, the market appears hesitant, reacting quickly to broader market jitters. A decrease in patient days, adjusted admissions and occupancy rate continues to hurt the company.\n\nThe balance sheet remains the biggest overhang. At the end of the third quarter, CYH held just $123 million in cash against $10.6 billion of long-term debt. A net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 7.6X stands well above the industry average of about 3.9X, reinforcing concerns that the company has limited flexibility if operating conditions soften.\n\nCYH continues to sell non-core assets to raise cash, including the recent sale of some outreach laboratory assets to **Labcorp Holdings Inc.** LH for roughly $194 million. More decisive deleveraging could help restore investor confidence.\n\nManagement expects net income per share to be between 80 cents and 90 cents in 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at 87 cents per share, which indicates a 184.5% year-over-year surge. However, the consensus mark for the 2026 bottom line indicates a return to negative territory. It is pegged at a loss of 51 cents per share, signaling doubts regarding the stock’s ability to sustain its margin gains.\n\n![Zacks Investment Research](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n## Community Health’s Valuation\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, CYH trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 0.04X, significantly down from the industry average of 0.68X. CYH carries a Value Score of A. Meanwhile, peer **Universal Health Services, Inc.** UHS is currently trading at 0.78X P/S. Yesterday, Universal Health fell 2.1%.\n\n![Zacks Investment Research](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCYH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The decision comes as the company shows resilience in rebar pricing and its valuation becomes more attractive. Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina noted that increased volumes and lower capital expenditures are expected to boost free cash flow for major steel producers, with protectionism supporting prices. The EBG segment is anticipated to drive CMC's earnings growth, potentially leading to further valuation improvements.\n\n## Company Overview and Market Position\n\nCommercial Metals Co operates steel mills, steel fabrication plants, and metal recycling facilities in the United States and manufactures rebar and structural steel, which are key product categories for the nonresidential construction sector. The company has three operating and reportable segments: North America Steel Group, Europe Steel Group, and Emerging Businesses Group. With a market capitalization of approximately $7.55 billion, CMC is a significant player in the Basic Materials sector, specifically within the steel industry.\n\n## Financial Health Analysis\n\nCommercial Metals Co's financial performance presents a mixed picture. The company's [revenue](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/revenue/CMC) stands at $7.8 billion, but it has experienced a [3-year revenue growth](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rvn-growth-3y/CMC) decline of -2.1%. Profitability metrics such as the [operating margin](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/operating-margin/CMC) and [net margin](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/net-margin/CMC) are at 6.67% and 1.09%, respectively, indicating room for improvement.\n\nThe company's balance sheet reflects strong financial health, with a [current ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/current-ratio/CMC) of 2.78 and a [debt-to-equity ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/debt-to-equity/CMC) of 0.32, suggesting a solid liquidity position. However, the [Altman Z-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/altman-zscore/CMC) of 3.89 indicates strong financial stability, while insider activity shows a balanced picture with both buying and selling transactions.\n\n## Valuation and Market Sentiment\n\nCommercial Metals Co's valuation metrics reveal a complex scenario. The [P/E ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pe-ratio/CMC) is notably high at 89.44, suggesting potential overvaluation compared to historical norms. The [P/S ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/CMC) of 0.97 and [P/B ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pb-ratio/CMC) of 1.8 are close to their respective 10-year highs, indicating a premium valuation.\n\nAnalyst sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a [recommendation score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/recommendation/CMC) of 2.4, suggesting a moderate buy. Technical indicators such as the [RSI](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rsi-14/CMC) of 65.96 indicate that the stock is approaching overbought territory. Institutional ownership is high at 92.81%, reflecting strong interest from large investors.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nWhile Commercial Metals Co demonstrates strong financial strength, as evidenced by its [Altman Z-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/zscore/CMC) and [Beneish M-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/mscore/CMC), sector-specific risks such as fluctuating steel prices and global economic conditions remain pertinent. The company's [beta](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/beta/CMC) of 1.59 indicates higher volatility compared to the market, which could impact investor sentiment.\n\nOverall, while Commercial Metals Co shows potential for growth, particularly in its Emerging Businesses Group, investors should remain cautious of the valuation metrics and sector-specific risks. The company's financial health is robust, but challenges in revenue and margin growth need to be addressed to sustain long-term performance.\n\n_This stock alert was generated using automated technology and GuruFocus financial data to provide readers with timely and accurate market reporting.

Morgan’s upgrade, tied to rebar pricing strength and potential synergies, influences Commercial Metals’ investment narrative.\n\n\nThe latest GPUs need a type of rare earth metal called Terbium and there are only [36 companies in the world exploring or producing it](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434418/rare-earth-metal-stocks/global?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=intro&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4270362). Find the list for free.\n\n## Commercial Metals Investment Narrative Recap\n\nTo own Commercial Metals, you need to believe in its ability to turn large capital projects and acquisitions into durable cash flows, despite recent margin pressure and earnings volatility. The new US$2.00 billion note issuance funds the planned Foley Products acquisition without immediately altering the most important short term catalyst, which remains rebar pricing support, while the biggest near term risk is still weaker profitability if costs stay elevated or construction demand softens.\n\nThe recent J.P. Morgan upgrade, citing resilient rebar pricing and potential synergies, ties directly into this story, as it frames how investors are viewing CMC’s acquisition pipeline and mill expansion projects like Arizona 2 and Steel West Virginia.

This achievement underscores the company’s robust performance, with a 35.3% year-to-date return and an impressive 31.47% gain over the past six months. [InvestingPro](https://au.investing.com/pro/CMC) data shows the stock has significantly outperformed its yearly growth of 10.39%. The upward trajectory in CMC’s stock price reflects investor confidence and positive market sentiment surrounding the company’s operations and future prospects. Analysts appear to share this optimism, with some setting price targets as high as $80 and forecasting EPS of $6.17 for fiscal year 2026. The company’s financial health is supported by a comfortable current ratio of 2.78 and moderate debt levels. As CMC continues to navigate the competitive metals industry, this new peak marks a noteworthy moment in its trading history, highlighting the company’s resilience and strategic growth initiatives. According to [InvestingPro](https://au.investing.com/pro/CMC), CMC is currently trading slightly above its Fair Value, and investors can access the comprehensive Pro Research Report covering this $7.55 billion market cap company for deeper insights.\n\nIn other recent news, Commercial Metals Company has completed a significant acquisition, purchasing Concrete Pipe & Precast, LLC for $675 million in cash. This acquisition expands Commercial Metals’ reach in the precast concrete and pipe product markets across the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic regions. Additionally, the company has successfully closed a $2 billion senior notes offering, consisting of $1 billion in 5.75% Senior Notes due 2033 and another $1 billion in 6.00% Senior Notes due 2035. The proceeds from this offering are intended to fund the acquisition of Foley Products Company, LLC and for general corporate purposes.\n\nIn terms of analyst activity, Jefferies has upgraded Commercial Metals’ stock rating from Hold to Buy, citing valuation as a key factor and setting a new price target of $78.00. Similarly, JPMorgan has upgraded the company’s stock from Neutral to Overweight, also setting a price target of $78.00. This upgrade is based on anticipated benefits from tariffs and an updated 2027 steel price forecast, which suggests potential upside for rebar and bar products. These developments reflect a period of strategic financial maneuvers and positive analyst sentiment for Commercial Metals Company.\n\n_This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

2025, 06:11 AM](https://www.tipranks.com/news/author/thefly)\n\nA+\n\nA-\n\nAs previously reported, Jefferies upgraded Commercial Metals ([CMC](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cmc)) to Buy from Hold with a [price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cmc/forecast) of $78, up from $70, following the stock’s recent underperformance and citing the continued resilience in rebar pricing. More broadly on the group, the analyst notes that U.S. steel prices have risen in recent weeks as [imports](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators) continue to decline and inventory levels fall, arguing that risk to consensus forecasts is “to the upside.”\n\n### TipRanks Cyber Monday Sale\n\n- [Claim 60% off TipRanks Premium](https://lp.tipranks.com/blackfriday-2025-b-premium/?coupon=BKFRCYMN2025P60&llf=rss&timer=on) for data-backed insights and research tools you need to invest with confidence.\n\n- [Subscribe to TipRanks' Smart Investor Picks](https://lp.tipranks.com/blackfriday-2025-b-smartinvestor/?coupon=BKFRCYMN2025P60&llf=rss&timer=on) and see our data in action through our high-performing model portfolio -  now also 60% off\n\n_Published first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

More than 800 people attended a [Wednesday virtual hearing](https://planetdetroit.org/2025/12/dte-data-center-hearing/) held by the MPSC on the data center contracts.\n\nProtesters say the deal has a lack of transparency, the potential for hidden costs, and environmental issues.\n\nThe state utility regulator has received more than 5,000 comments on the electric contracts for the hyperscale data center, which is planned for 250 acres of a 575-acre site in Saline Township, south of Ann Arbor.

A spokesperson for the MPSC declined to comment on this story.\n\nDTE previously said the power contracts for the 1.4-gigawatt Saline Township data center project could be canceled without regulatory approval by Friday, Dec. 5.\n\nThe timeline for the project is set by the developer and customer, not DTE, the utility's spokesperson Jill Wilmot said in a Monday email.\n\n\"The customer and developer have indicated they need to start construction at the beginning of the year to move forward with the Saline Township site,\" Wilmot said.\n\nThe contracts under consideration by the MPSC contain a provision allowing the customer to terminate the deal if the agreements were not approved by Dec. 5, she said.\n\n\"However, we always knew that the contracts may not be addressed at the December 5 MPSC meeting, and the decision could be extended to a date later in the year.\"\n\nPlanet Detroit contacted Related Digital, the developer of the Saline Township data center; Oracle; and OpenAI for comment on this story and the status of the data center project.\n\nNessel, Whitmer on opposite sides of Saline data center decision\n\nAttorney General Dana Nessel, who is pushing for regulators to allow a contested case for the data center contracts, said in a Friday statement that DTE wanted approval by Dec. 5 before stating its deadline could be extended to Dec. 19.\n\n\"This manufactured timeline was all a pressure tactic to rush through a heavily redacted contract that – for some reason – DTE does not want my office or the public to see,\" Nessel said.\n\n\"This ‘new’ deadline only became public after my office filed a notice to intervene and is precisely why we need a contested case and full public proceedings. We can’t just take DTE’s word that Michigan ratepayers won’t be left footing the bill for this data center.\"\n\nDTE has maintained that the Saline Township data center will not increase costs for the utility's other customers.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer is at odds with Nessel on the Saline Township development and said in a letter of support last week the data center will create jobs, adding that her office reviewed the project's environmental and ratepayer protections to ensure residents are not negatively impacted.\n\nThe editorial boards of both of Detroit's daily newspapers came out against fast-track approval of the Saline Township data center in the last week.\n\nOn Thursday, the Detroit Free Press said Whitmer should support Nessel's request for a 90-day review of the data center contracts.\n\nOn Saturday, The Detroit News said Whitmer has \"lost her credibility\" in the matter, citing her appointment of Shaquila Myers to the MPSC earlier this year and DTE-linked contributions to Whitmer's Road to Michigan's Future nonprofit.\n\nPlanet Detroit contacted Whitmer's office for comment on this story and the newspaper editorials.\n\nDTE: Negotiations underway on 3 gigawatts of additional data center deals\n\nThe Saline Township data center will drive $300 million in annual affordability benefits for DTE's existing customers once it's \"fully ramped,\" DTE said in the business update released Friday.\n\nThe utility has \"confidence that additional data center opportunities provide upside\" to its long-term plan, the presentation said.\n\nDTE has 3 gigawatts of data center deals in late-stage negotiations, the company said in the Friday update.\n\nBetween 2026 and 2032, DTE said it plans to add 12 gigawatts of capacity: 2.5 gigawatts of storage, including data centers; 8 gigawatts in renewables; and 1.5 gigawatts from combined cycle gas turbine generation with carbon capture and storage.\n\nPlanet Detroit reported last month on how data center power demands could trigger an \"off ramp\" in Michigan's 2023 renewable energy law.\n\nThe Saline Township project will be supported by battery storage and will not require new fossil fuel generation, DTE CEO Joi Harris said on the utility's third-quarter earnings call Oct. 30.\n\n“Any new data center load that we bring on after this 1.4 gigawatts will require additional resources,” Harris said, adding that a project in the 1-gigawatt range would require a “combined cycle,” referring to a combined cycle gas plant.\n\nRead Planet Detroit’s Guides to data centers and the MPSC.\n\n🗳️ What's next? Tips for civic action\n\nWhy it matters\n⚡ Opponents of a proposal to fast-track approval of an Oracle and Open AI data center in Saline Township say it could impact DTE Energy customers’ utility bills, which the utility denies. Supporters of the project like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer say it will create thousands of temporary construction jobs, hundreds of permanent jobs, and bring tax dollars to local communities.\nData center power demands could make it more difficult for the state to meet its climate goals, depending on what generation sources are used.\n\nWho’s making civic decisions\n🏛️ The Michigan Public Service Commission, the state utility regulator, will consider DTE’s filing for the Saline data center and could allow for a contested case in which testimony can be submitted. Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy will decide on a wetland permit for the facility.\n\nHow to take civic action now\n\n• 📅 Attend  the MPSC’s next regular meeting from 1-2 p.m. on Dec. 18 in person at the Michigan Public Service Commission, 7109 W. Saginaw Highway, Lansing, Michigan, 48917 in person or via videoconference.\nAt 6 p.m. on Dec. 18, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy will hold a virtual hearing on a permit application for the Saline data center’s proposed wetland, stream, and floodplain impacts. To attend the online hearing, register at https://bit.ly/WRD121825.  After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting. To join by phone, call 855-758-1310 and use meeting ID 841 0513 8539 #.\n\n• 🌱 Follow the Sierra Club Michigan Chapter and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan for advocates’ viewpoints on MPSC activities.\n\n• 📩 Email the MPSC at LARA-MPSC-commissioners@michigan.gov. Public comments can be made to EGLE on the agency’s public notice webpage for the wetland permit.\n\n• ✉️ Mail the Michigan Public Service Commission, PO Box 30221, Lansing, MI 48909\n\n• 📣 Ask the commission if it will open DTE’s filing for the Saline Township data center as a contested case.\n\nWhat to watch for next\n🗓️ The MPSC holds its next meeting on Dec. 18, in person and virtually at 1 p.m., where it could make a decision on DTE’s application.\n\nCivic impact\n🌍 Following and engaging with Michigan’s utility regulator is one way residents can influence the impact data centers have in the state.\n\n⭐️ Please let us know what action you took or if you have any additional questions.

(Spectrum News/Jack Caron)\n\n\n\nNEWS\n\n# DTE Energy offers energy-saving tips as tem­pa­tures drop\n\nBY\n\n\n\n\nJack Caron\n\nMichigan\n\nPUBLISHED 4:06 PM ET Dec. 08, 2025PUBLISHED 4:06 PM EST Dec. 08, 2025\n\nSHARE\n\nDETROIT — As winter temperatures drop and heating costs climb, DTE Energy is advising customers on ways to reduce their electric bills through simple home improvements and new rebate programs.\n\nThe utility company recommends starting with basic weatherization measures to combat rising heating expenses.\n\n“I would say that your best \\[bet\\] to save energy and feel more comfortable in your home is to block off air. Leaks are coming into the house, so looking into weatherstripping and sealing around your windows and doors will keep that air from leaking into the house itself,” said Jason Kupser, manager of energy efficiency at DTE.\n\n* * *\n\n#### **What You Need To Know**\n\n##### - **Seal drafty windows and doors:** Use weatherstripping to block air leaks and keep warm air inside your home, one of the simplest ways to reduce heating costs.   - **Lower your thermostat when away:** Adjust the temperature down when you’re not home or sleeping to cut energy usage without sacrificing comfort. - **Monitor your furnace:** Regular maintenance and filter changes help your heating system run efficiently and prevent costly repairs.   - **Take advantage of DTE rebates:** The utility offers automatic rebates through its online marketplace for customers who purchase programmable or smart thermostats.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n* * *\n\nDTE is expanding its cost-saving options with rebates and bill credits for customers who install smart thermostats. The company has launched an online marketplace where customers can receive automatic rebates when purchasing programmable or smart thermostats.\n\n“We’ve got, actually, an online marketplace where you can get an automatic rebate for purchasing the programmable thermostat or a smart thermostat,” Kupser said.\n\nThe [energy-efficiency programs](https://rebates.dteenergy.com/) come as Michigan residents prepare for higher winter heating bills amid fluctuating energy prices. DTE serves approximately 2.3 million electric customers in southeastern Michigan.\n\nThe utility company says the energy-saving measures can help customers manage their bills during the coldest months of the year.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n# You May Also Be Interested In\n\n[SPORTS](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/mi/michigan/news/2025/12/10/claressa-shields-facing-franchon-crews-dezurn-in-detroit-in-first-bout-of-her--8m--multi-fight-deal)\n\n[![Franchon Crews-Dezurn, left, follows through on a punch to Claressa Shields during a women's super middleweight boxing bout, Nov. 19, 2016, in Las Vegas.

The team with the second-lowest score on a hole will receive one point. The team with the highest score will receive no points.\n- Whenever teams finish with the same score on a hole, those teams will be awarded the same number of points.\n- If two teams finish with the lowest score on a hole, each team will receive one and a half points. The third team, finishing with the highest score, will receive no points.\n- If one team finishes with the lowest score on a hole and the other two finish with the same (higher) score, the team with the lowest score will receive two points, with the other two teams receiving a half point.\n- If all three teams finish with the same score on a hole, each team will receive one point.\n\n### Definitions\n\n- **Six Ball (Best Ball):**Each player plays his own ball for the entire hole, and the lowest score from each team is used.\n- **Scotch Sixsomes (Modified Alternate-Shot):**Each player hits a tee shot, and the team then selects one tee shot to play from. Alternate-shot play begins from there, with the player whose drive was not selected hitting the second shot on the hole.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team USA | Thursday a.m. | Thursday p.m. | Friday a.m. | Friday p.m. | Sunday a.m. | Sunday p.m. | Total Points |\n| Jason Caron | 7 | 9.5 | 11 | 11.5 | 10.5 | 11 | 60.5 |\n| Stewart Cink | 7 | 9.5 | 11 | 11.5 | 7.5 | 7 | 53.5 |\n| Steve Flesch | 9 | 8.5 | 8.5 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 48 |\n| Jerry Kelly | 9 | 8.5 | 8.5 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 51 |\n| Justin Leonard | 9 | 9.5 | 7.5 | 9 | 7 | 9.5 | 51.5 |\n| Steve Stricker | 9 | 9.5 | 7.5 | 9 | 6 | 7 | 48 |\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team Europe | Thursday a.m. | Thursday p.m. | Friday a.m. | Friday p.m. | Sunday a.m. | Sunday p.m. | Total Points |\n| Thomas Bjørn | 10 | 11 | 9.5 | 8 | 12.5 | 7 | 58 |\n| Alex Cejka | 10.5 | 9.5 | 9 | 7.5 | 12.5 | 0 | 49 |\n| Darren Clarke | 10 | 11 | 9.5 | 8 | 11.5 | 7 | 57 |\n| Miguel Angel Jiménez | 7.5 | 8.5 | 11.5 | 7 | 8 | 9.5 | 52 |\n| Søren Kjeldsen | 10.5 | 9.5 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 41 |\n| Bernhard Langer | 0 | 0 | 0 | 7.5 | 7.5 | 12 | 27 |\n| Colin Montgomerie | 7.5 | 8.5 | 11.5 | 7 | 10.5 | 10.5 | 55.5 |\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Team International** | Thursday a.m. | Thursday p.m. | Friday a.m. | Friday p.m. | Sunday a.m. | Sunday p.m. | Total Points |\n| Steven Alker | 10 | 6.5 | 10.5 | 10.5 | 13.5 | 8 | 59 |\n| Ángel Cabrera | 7.5 | 8 | 0 | 12 | 9 | 9.5 | 46 |\n| K.J.

Big names. And a unique format. The Skechers World Champions Cup is back. (And Team Europe is still winning…)\n\nDecember can be a bit of a dead month for tour golf. The PGA Tour and DP World Tour seasons have wrapped up, the next LIV event is miles down the road, and most of the game’s biggest names are either on holiday or grinding quietly ahead of the new year. But that lull leaves a perfect little window – and the Skechers World Champions Cup jumps straight into it.\n\nWhilst it might not be the first event you highlight on the calendar, the Skechers World Champions Cup has a lot going for it: big names, fun formats, and a mix of competitive action and late-season silliness.\n\nLaunched in 2023 as part of the PGA Tour Champions schedule, the 2024 edition was cancelled due to hurricanes that hit the area a few weeks before it was due to take place, but the event is back this year with a new sponsor, a new name, and a new venue.\n\n## What is the Skechers World Champions Cup?\n\nThe Skechers World Champions Cup Supporting Shriners Children’s, to give it its full name, sees three six-man teams of legendary golfers go head-to-head. There’s a US team, a European team, and an International team. Team USA won the inaugural event in 2023.\n\n### Skechers World Champions Cup captains and teams\n\nEach team has six players, led by a playing captain, plus a pair of non-playing vice captains.\n\nThe lineups for 2025 were as follows:\n\n**Team USA:** Jim Furyk (captain), Stewart Cink, Jerry Kelly, Justin Leonard, Steve Stricker, Jason Caron\n\n**Team International:** Mike Weir (captain), Steven Alker, Angel Cabrera, KJ Choi, YE Yang, Mark Hensby\n\n**Team Europe:** Darren Clarke (captain), Thomas Bjorn, Miguel Ángel Jiménez, Bernhard Langer, Colin Montgomerie, Alex Cejka\n\n![Feather Sound will host the Skechers World Champions Cup.](https://todaysgolfer-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/274208/876x584/feather-sound-golf-course.jpg)\n\n### Where is the Skechers World Champions Cup played?\n\nThe 2025 Skechers World Champions Cup took place at Feather Sound Country Club in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nThe inaugural 2023 edition was held at The Concession Club in Bradenton and it was due to return there last year before the weather forced the cancellation.\n\nFeather Sound – a 7,332-yard par-72 – is one of the area’s toughest tracks and hosted the 2024 Aramco Team Series on the Ladies European Tour.\n\n### What is the format of the Skechers World Champions Cup?\n\nWhile the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup lean on foursomes, fourballs, and singles, the Skechers World Champions Cup serves up an interesting mix of Scotch sixsomes, sixballs, and singles. You’ve probably got questions about those, so here’s a breakdown…\n\n**Scotch sixsome**\n\nBoth players in each two-man team will tee off on every hole. One ball is chosen and then alternate strokes are played to complete the hole. The team with the lowest score on each hole will receive two points. The team with the second-lowest score on a hole will receive one point. The team with the highest score will receive no points. Whenever teams finish with the same score on a hole, those teams will be awarded the same number of points.\n\n**Sixball**\n\nEach member of a two-man team plays his own ball, so six golf balls are in play on every hole. Each team counts the lowest of its two scores on each hole, and the team with the lowest score on each hole will receive two points. The team with the second-lowest score on a hole will receive one point. The team with the highest score will receive no points. Whenever teams finish with the same score on a hole, those teams will be awarded the same number of points.\n\n**Singles**\n\nEach grouping features one player from each team. The player with the lowest score on each hole will receive two points. The player with the second-lowest score on a hole will receive one point. The player with the highest score will receive no points. Whenever players finish with the same score on a hole, those teams will be awarded the same number of points.\n\nEach team must complete each hole and as a result all groupings will be played in their entirety (nine holes). There are no close outs or concessions.\n\nStill confused? You’re not alone. Even some of the players struggle to get their heads around the format – though they embrace the uniqueness of it.\n\n“The points system, the three teams, it’s amazing. It gets complicated and it’s fun,” says Steve Alker. “It’s just a fun event. It’s great for TV, too.”\n\n“I think match play is a great thing,” says Stewart Cink. “Even though it’s not by definition match play, it’s a three-way kind of a combination match thing. It’s an intriguing format and it’s great personalities and it will be tight competition. It’s only nine-hole matches. I think it’s going to be awesome. I haven’t played on a team event myself in about 15 years, so going to be a blast to do it.”\n\n### What is the prize money at the Skechers World Champions Cup?\n\nThe total purse of $1.35 million. Each member of the winning team will take home $100,000. Second-place team members will get $75,000, while third-place is worth $50,000 per player.\n\n### Who won the Skechers World Champions Cup?\n\nSo far, two editions of the three-team tournament have taken place. The results are as follows…\n\n**2025**\n\nInspired by Ryder Cup legend Colin Montgomerie, Darren Clarke’s European team dusted their rivals at Feather Sound, finished 16.5 points ahead of the International team in second.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **POSITION** | **TEAM** | **POINTS** |\n| 1 | Europe | 230 |\n| 2 | International | 213.5 |\n| 3 | USA | 204.5 |\n\n**2024**\n\nThe 2024 World Champions Cup was cancelled due to Hurricane Helene.\n\n**2023**\n\nThe United States won the inaugural World Champions Cup, which was a tense affair at The Concession Club.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **POSITION** | **TEAM** | **POINTS** |\n| 1 | USA | 221 |\n| 2 | International | 219 |\n| 3 | Europe | 208 |\n\n* * *\n\n- [Is Rory McIlroy the best European golfer of all time?

Today, things are a bit simpler, as singles matches are the featured groupings in the morning and afternoon sessions.\n\nScoring is still based on points earned, not strokes. Team Europe leads the PGA TOUR Champions event with 109.5 points, with Team USA second at 108 and Team International third at 106.5. Each hole awards three points, split among the golfers based on their scores on that hole. Essentially, every hole is a new match with another opportunity to add points to the team total.\n\n**Sunday, Dec. 7: Morning Wave – Singles**\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Starting Time** | **Team USA** | **Team Europe** | **Team International** |\n| 8:00 a.m. | Stewart Cink | Colin Montgomerie | Ángel Cabrera |\n| 8:10 a.m. | Jerry Kelly | Darren Clarke | Mike Weir |\n| 8:20 a.m. | Justin Leonard | Thomas Bjørn | K.J.

Jason Caron was the only member of Team USA scoring in double digits posting 10.5-points.\n\nThe morning session ended in a steady downpour as liquid sunshine bathed the Feather Sound course layout.\n\n[![](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sun-AM-1.jpg)](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sun-AM-1.jpg)[![](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sun-AM-2.jpg)](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sun-AM-2.jpg)\n\nSkies cleared quickly as the afternoon session teed off before noon under a high cloud ceiling.\n\n**Sunday, Dec. 7: Afternoon Wave – Singles**\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Starting Time** | **Team USA** | **Team Europe** | **Team International** |\n| 11:15 a.m. | Stewart Cink | Colin Montgomerie | Ángel Cabrera |\n| 11:25 a.m. | Jerry Kelly | Darren Clarke | Mike Weir |\n| 11:35 a.m. | Justin Leonard | Thomas Bjørn | K.J.

Yang |\n| 12:05 p.m. | Steve Stricker | Bernhard Langer | Steven Alker |\n\nTeam Europe picked up right where they left off, consistently adding to their lead. A light rain returned midway through the afternoon session. However, the moisture did not dampen the pace of play or the European charge to complete the rout of their two rivals. Colin Montgomerie led the stampede into the clubhouse posting 10.5-points, finishing with the first group to complete the afternoon 9-holes.\n\n[![](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8228.jpg)](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8228.jpg) Colin Montgomerie / Lasco Press Photo\n\nThe shot of the tournament came from Bernhard Langer. After making consecutive birdies on the first four holes of the afternoon session. The World Hall of Fame golfer from Germany dropped an eagle 3 from the fairway on the par-five 5th-hole. Langer’s session total of 12-points tied Søren Kjeldsen for the team high score in the afternoon\n\n[![](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251207_133840.jpg)](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251207_133840.jpg) Lasco Press Photo\n\nUmbrellas continued to pop open as the intensity of the rain increased. Team Europe closed out an impressive win.\n\n[![](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final-Points-Totals.jpg)](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final-Points-Totals.jpg)\n\n[![](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Afternoon-1.jpg)](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Afternoon-1.jpg)[![](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Afternoon-2.jpg)](https://www.thelascopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Afternoon-2.jpg)\n\nSome solace for Team USA.

The landfill is suing Wolverine Worldwide and 3M over PFAS costs. (Garret Ellison \\| MLive)Garret Ellison\n\nBy\n\n- [Garret Ellison \\| gellison@mlive.com](https://www.mlive.com/staff/gellison/ \"Garret Ellison at gellison@mlive.com\")\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, MI — Two West Michigan landfills are suing Wolverine Worldwide and 3M Corp., alleging the companies are responsible for years of PFAS contamination tied to the disposal of contaminated tannery sludge from former shoemaking in Rockford.\n\nCentral Sanitary Landfill in Pierson Township and Ottawa County Farms Landfill in Coopersville filed the complaint Dec. 4 in U.S. District Court, seeking reimbursement for investigation, monitoring and leachate-management costs they allege stem directly from Wolverine’s [long-running use of PFAS-laden Scotchgard chemicals](https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/06/how-citizen-sleuths-cracked-the-wolverine-tannery-pollution-case.html \"https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/06/how-citizen-sleuths-cracked-the-wolverine-tannery-pollution-case.html\").\n\nThe landfills claim they’ve spent years installing monitoring wells, providing temporary water supplies to nearby homes and developing new leachate disposal systems because of PFAS traced to Wolverine’s waste stream. The Ottawa landfill [built an injection well](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/01/michigan-landfill-plans-to-inject-waste-beneath-shrinking-aquifer.html) to put treated leachate more than 5,400 feet underground “because of the disposal of tannery waste,” the filing claims.\n\nThe case is assigned to Judge Robert Jonker.\n\nLandfill attorneys did not returns messages seeking comment last week, nor did spokespeople for 3M. The chemical manufacturer has settled many of the largest drinking-water and environmental damage cases related to PFAS, but litigation continues as the legal net reaches into new areas such as waste disposal and product liability.\n\nThrough a public relations firm, Wolverine Worldwide pointed to other sources of PFAS entering the landfills, which undoubtedly contain discarded consumer items made with the ubiquitous chemicals.\n\n“Both of these large landfills have been in operation for decades, accepting waste from hundreds of commercial and industrial sources,” Wolverine said. “We are reviewing this lawsuit and will vigorously defend ourselves in court.”\n\nNonetheless, the complaint portrays Wolverine as a significant contributor to PFAS at the two landfills.\n\nWolverine began waterproofing leather for Hush Puppies shoes using 3M Scotchgard at its former downtown Rockford tannery in 1958. Following decades of disposal in [gravel pits](https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/08/polluted-golf-course-irrigation-blamed-for-pfas-in-drinking-water.html \"https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/08/polluted-golf-course-irrigation-blamed-for-pfas-in-drinking-water.html\") and [farmland](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2017/12/wolverine_agreed_not_to_pollut.html \"https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2017/12/wolverine_agreed_not_to_pollut.html\") that subsequently poisoned groundwater in a [25-square-mile area](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/09/wolverine-worldwide-3m-to-pay-54m-in-pfas-class-settlement.html \"https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/09/wolverine-worldwide-3m-to-pay-54m-in-pfas-class-settlement.html\") of northern Kent County, the company began dumping at the Central landfill in the mid-1980s.\n\nAccording to previous MLive reporting, the Central landfill [accepted tannery sludge and sent leachate](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2017/11/wolverine_pierson_landfill.html), or contaminated rainwater that collects at the bottom of a landfill, back to Rockford for treatment at Wolverine’s former wastewater plant along the Rogue River. Neither facility had a treatment system capable of removing PFAS chemicals, which entered the river though [contaminated discharge and groundwater](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/07/rogue-river-becomes-a-major-focal-point-in-wolverine-pfas-cleanup-planning.html \"https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/07/rogue-river-becomes-a-major-focal-point-in-wolverine-pfas-cleanup-planning.html\").\n\nIn Montcalm County, groundwater around the Central landfill is contaminated [by extremely high levels of PFAS](https://www.michigan.gov/pfasresponse/investigations/sites-aoi/montcalm-county/central-sanitary-landfill). The landfill has supplied bottled water and household filtration to [neighboring residences](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2018/04/anger_anxiety_about_pfas_at_pi.html) and operates a groundwater treatment system.\n\n![Central Sanitary Landfill in Pierson](https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/GLOQA3A4NJE67C6JQTWBOEEXUM.jpg?auth=9498b8d2566e1c6f4ee36d443cbcbe662e98ec5be3d4db9152da6d470d2e44bd&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90)The Central Sanitary Landfill in Pierson Township, Nov. 1, 2017.Nic Antaya \\| MLive\n\nWhile the Central landfill has long been publicly tied to Wolverine, the Ottawa landfill has not. The filing does not specify dates tannery waste allegedly went there, only that the facility has been forced to manage leachate through expensive deep well injection.\n\nThe Ottawa landfill is not listed as a contaminated site on a state PFAS list and a Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) PFAS [mapping tool](https://egle.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=bdec7880220d4ccf943aea13eba102db) does not show any ground or surface water testing in the immediate vicinity.\n\nBoth Type II landfills formerly sent contaminated leachate to the Grand Rapids wastewater treatment plant, which discharges to the Grand River, a Lake Michigan tributary.\n\nBoth landfills are owned by Republic Services, one of the nation’s largest waste management companies. In Tennessee, Republic is being sued by the city of Murfreesboro over allegations that leachate and runoff from its Middle Point landfill have introduced PFAS into nearby springs, groundwater and surface water.\n\nThe lawsuits come roughly 8 years after Wolverine’s widespread groundwater contamination was [brought to light in 2017](https://www.mlive.com/news/2017/08/wolverine_pfas_house_st_dump.html).\n\nThey follow the 2024 federal listing of PFOS and PFOA as “ [hazardous substances](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2024/04/epa-designates-two-pfas-chemicals-as-hazardous-substances.html)” under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA. The landfills argue both 3M and Wolverine “arranged for disposal” of hazardous substances under the Superfund law, making them responsible for remedial costs.\n\nThe federal listing was finalized under the Biden administration. Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Trump has moved to rollback or delay other aspects of PFAS regulation, the EPA [stated this fall](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-next-steps-regulatory-pfoa-and-pfos-cleanup-efforts-provides) that it will retain the CERCLA listing.\n\nPFAS are a class of thousands of fluorinated chemicals used in nonstick and stain-resistant products which have contaminated drinking water, soil and surface water across Michigan. Wolverine’s dumping discovery [triggered](https://www.mlive.com/news/2017/11/michigan_pfas_response_team.html) the state’s first large PFAS investigations, ultimately prompting a [$69.5 million settlement](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2024/01/wolverine-worldwide-to-get-4-more-years-pay-for-water-mains.html) between the company, the state and two townships, and a statewide PFAS surveillance program.\n\nThis year, Wolverine launched [a groundwater treatment system](https://www.mlive.com/environment/2024/09/wolverine-worldwide-pfas-cleanup-takes-shape-after-years-of-delay.html) at its former tannery and completed a cap over its infamous House Street dump.

This typically allows us to produce figures that end up being within 10% of the actual totals._\n\n_This data is regularly compared against official shipment figures released by the console manufacturers and figures estimated by regional trackers with greater market coverage than ourselves. We then update our own estimates to bring them into line with those figures. This can result in frequent changes often within a short space of time, but we feel it's important to prioritise accuracy over consistency._\n\n_Note that our estimates are based on sell-through data (units sold to consumers). In almost all cases the figures released by console manufacturers are based on shipment data (sell-in), where as soon as a device has left the factory and entered the supply chain for delivery it is considered a sale. This is why there is always a difference between the companies’ figures (sell-in) and VGChartz estimates (sell-through), even after we’ve made adjustments. The one exception to that is when a console has been discontinued and the remaining stock has finally sold out – at that point the figures will match._\n\n* * *\n\n_A life-long and avid gamer,_ [William D'Angelo](https://www.vgchartz.com/author/79/william-dangelo/) _was first introduced to VGChartz in 2007.

This slight adjustment reflects a market narrative that is becoming cautiously more constructive on execution and innovation, yet still weighed down by unresolved PFAS liabilities and uneven end market demand. Read on to see how this evolving balance of optimism and risk is shaping 3M's story and how you can stay on top of future shifts in the narrative.\n\nStay updated as the Fair Value for [3M](https://www.simplywall.st//company/id/6aeea5d0-c989-4cc6-bb80-e9498219676e/valuation?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=stay_updated_cta&utm_source=yahoo) shifts by adding it to your [watchlist](https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=stay_updated_cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4272998) or [portfolio](https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=stay_updated_cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4272998). Alternatively, explore our [Community](https://simplywall.st/community/narratives?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=stay_updated_cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4272998) to discover new perspectives on 3M.\n\n## What Wall Street Has Been Saying\n\n**🐂 Bullish Takeaways**\n\n- Morgan Stanley has moved from an Underweight to Equal Weight stance, lifting its target to $160. The firm argues that reset expectations and better calibrated forward organic sales set up a more constructive risk or reward profile around 3M's valuation.\n\n- Barclays, which remains Overweight, raised its target to $180. The bank cites stronger organic growth and early benefits from new product introductions as evidence that execution and innovation are starting to support above macro growth into 2026.\n\n- Citi nudged its target to $169 while staying Neutral, reflecting recognition of improving end market pockets, such as data center demand. The firm also notes some caution that parts of the growth story and near term upside may already be reflected in the share price.\n\n- Deutsche Bank's short term \"Catalyst Call: Buy\" highlights the potential for upside surprises to guidance if management continues to execute on cost control and product momentum, especially against a backdrop of subdued investor sentiment.\n\n\n**🐻 Bearish Takeaways**\n\n- RBC Capital raised its target only modestly to $130 and keeps an Underperform rating. The firm warns that multiple multi billion dollar PFAS litigation categories remain unaddressed and unreserved, a risk it believes is underappreciated relative to the current valuation.\n\n- Even among more constructive firms, such as Citi and Morgan Stanley, ratings at Neutral or Equal Weight signal that better execution and growth momentum are partially priced in. Legal overhangs and mixed demand outside stronger niches could still constrain multiple expansion.\n\n\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts? Perhaps you think there's more to the story.

The company also joined the JOINT3 next generation semiconductor packaging consortium and launched a manufacturing partnership in Indonesia for ceramic sand screens to deepen its technology and energy exposure.\n\n\n## How This Changes the Fair Value For 3M\n\n- The Fair Value Estimate has edged down slightly to $174.25 from $174.94, reflecting a modest reassessment of intrinsic value.\n\n- The Discount Rate has remained effectively unchanged at 7.67%, signaling a nearly unchanged view of 3M's risk profile and required return.\n\n- Revenue Growth has been effectively maintained at 2.50% (2.4972% vs. 2.4972%), indicating no meaningful change in top-line growth assumptions.\n\n- The Net Profit Margin remains essentially flat at about 19.24%, with only a minimal upward adjustment in long-term profitability expectations.\n\n- The Future P/E has slipped slightly to 21.0x from 21.1x, implying a very small reduction in the forward valuation multiple applied to earnings.\n\n\n## 🔔 Never Miss an Update: Follow The Narrative\n\nNarratives on Simply Wall St let investors turn raw numbers into a living story, connecting their view of a company’s future revenue, earnings, and margins to a fair value estimate.

THEFT: Ronald Jansen, 54, was convicted of theft and sentenced in the Gqeberha Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday (123RF/ danhenson)\n\nA Gqeberha man who was part of an elaborate scheme to systematically misappropriate platinum plates from his employer and sell them to scrap metal dealers has been jailed.\n\nThe company suffered a total loss of more than R6.3m as a result of the scheme.\n\nRonald Jansen, 54, was convicted in the Gqeberha Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday on a count of theft.\n\nHe was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, of which he was ordered to serve 10 months behind bars and thereafter be released on correctional supervision.\n\nThe Gqeberha Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit, working with the Priority Crime Specialised Investigation Unit and the National Prosecuting Authority, re-arrested Jansen in October.\n\nAccording to court papers, between April 2021 and May 2022, employees of Minileit (Pty) Ltd, situated in Gqeberha, conspired and acted in common purpose to systematically misappropriate company stock consisting of platinum plates.\n\nThe stolen material was unlawfully sold to nearby scrap metal businesses.\n\nAn in-depth investigation uncovered alleged internal collusion and fraudulent disposals.\n\nThis breakthrough culminated in the arrest and prosecution of four suspects in 2023.\n\nJansen and his co-accused Ruwayne Leppan, 38, Roual Martin, 32, and Quewin September, 27, were all released on bail.\n\nThe case against the remaining accused is still at a trial stage and was postponed to January 12.\n\n**The Herald**\n\n* * *\n\n## Editor’s Choice\n\n1\n\n[**Churches, families and employers still shut out people living with HIV, report

-2.1% in Monday's trading as Deutsche Bank downgraded shares to Hold from Buy with a $178 price target, trimmed from $199, noting a 64% gain since the bank raised the stock to Buy in July 2024, largely due to the company's hiring of the well-respected industrial CEO Bill Brown to run the company.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts led by Nicole DeBlase praised Brown for his \"very credible\" 2025-27 financial plan and regular updates to the investment community that indicate encouraging and perhaps better than expected progress on the company's ( [MMM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMM#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews \"3M Company\")) margin expansion, which has caused very little pushback to the bank's bullish view on 3M's margin opportunity.\n\n\"As a result, we now see only very low single-digit upside to consensus forecasts through 2028, and the stock's

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.35% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.45%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.14%.\n\nShares of the largest U.S. health insurer have appreciated by 2.07% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Medical sector's gain of 5.67%, and outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 1.2%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of UnitedHealth Group in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, UnitedHealth Group is projected to report earnings of $2.07 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 69.6%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $113.53 billion, up 12.62% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $16.29 per share and a revenue of $447.97 billion, representing changes of -41.11% and +11.91%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for UnitedHealth Group. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.13% downward. UnitedHealth Group presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that UnitedHealth Group has a Forward P/E ratio of 20.32 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 13.6.\n\nIt is also worth noting that UNH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.16. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Medical - HMOs was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.28 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Medical - HMOs industry is part of the Medical sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 202, positioning it in the bottom 19% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Photo by Alena Maschke\n\n_This story was first reported by [Louisiana Illuminator](https://lailluminator.com/) and republished with permission_.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry’s administration is abruptly ending contracts with two of the six companies that provide Medicaid insurance in Louisiana, a move that could leave 488,500 residents uncertain of what health care they will have starting Jan. 1.\n\nSeth Gold, Louisiana’s Medicaid director, sent short letters last week to the CEOs of Aetna Better Health of Louisiana and UnitedHealthCare of Louisiana announcing their contract extensions with the state had been dropped for 2026. The Illuminator obtained copies of the letters Monday from the Louisiana Department of Health.\n\n“LDH will begin the transition process of moving your Medicaid members to other contracted Medicaid Managed Care Plans for a Jan. 1 effective date,” Gold wrote in the letters to the companies dated Dec. 2.\n\nThe news came as a surprise to state lawmakers, who voted less than two weeks ago to [extend the state’s agreements](https://lailluminator.com/2025/11/25/louisiana-lawmakers-approve-the-biggest-government-contracts-in-the-states-history/) with both companies at the urging of the Landry administration.\n\n![a man in a suit sits on a dais](https://media.thecurrentla.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/08121056/IMG_1620-2048x1365-1-600x400.jpg)\n\nPublished:\nDecember 8, 12:11 pm\n\n[Louisiana ethics board fines Congressman Cleo Fields for missing campaign report](https://thecurrentla.com/2025/louisiana-ethics-board-fines-congressman-cleo-fields-for-missing-campaign-report/)\n\nThe state ethics board fined Congressman Cleo Fields for not submitting a report documenting the remaining funds and debts in a decades-old campaign account.\n\nAttorney General Liz Murrill and other state officials said litigation over pharmacy benefit managers affiliated with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare were factors in stepping away from agreements with the companies.\n\nSpokespeople for the companies did not respond to requests for comment Monday evening.\n\nAetna and UnitedHealthCare provide Medicaid insurance for 157,800 and 330,700 Louisiana residents, respectively, covering one-third of its [1.53 million enrollees](https://jlcb.legis.la.gov/Docs/2025/nov2025/Agenda%20Item%2012%20November%20Medicaid%20Report.pdf).\n\nAetna’s contract for the fiscal years 2026 and 2027  –  a time period which started July 1 and ends June 30, 2027 – is $2.59 billion. The UnitedHealthCare contract for the same time period is $2.06 billion, according to [documents posted publicly in November](https://jlcb.legis.la.gov/default_Archives2025).\n\nIn an interview Monday night, Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said his department plans to move the enrollees with Aetna and UniteHealthCare coverage to new health plans before the end of the year. He’s confident the four other companies offering Medicaid plans will be able to handle the influx of new patients.\n\nAmeriHealth Caritas, Elevance Health, Humana and Louisiana Healthcare Connections are the other private companies who provide Medicaid plans in the state.\n\nThe health department is going to use an algorithm to help pick a plan for each person who needs to switch from Aetna or UnitedHealthCare, according to Greenstein. It will prioritize keeping families together with the same health care company and making sure the doctors and other medical professionals a person sees most frequently take their new insurance.\n\n“This will take place over the next two weeks, so it will take place over Christmas,” Greenstein said. “I feel confident that we will be able to execute on this.”\n\nIf a Medicaid recipient is unhappy with their new health care coverage, they will have 90 days starting Jan. 1 to switch into another plan, Greenstein said.\n\nThe state’s ongoing litigation with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare over their pharmacy benefit managers pushed the state to end their contracts with the companies, Greenstein and Murrill confirmed.\n\nIn a text message Monday afternoon, Murrill said the companies “are not compliant with \\[state law\\] and until they are, they are ineligible for contract extensions.”\n\n![Woman in a red jacket sitting in a white chair with an official seal](https://media.thecurrentla.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09085306/PXL_20251028_163654244.PORTRAIT-scaled-1-1200x675.jpg)Attorney General Liz Murrill\n\nPharmacy benefit managers are middlemen who negotiate prescription drug plans with insurers and drug manufacturers. Murrill and Landry have repeatedly criticized these entities, which are often owned by large health care corporations, of unfair business practices that undercut locally owned pharmacies.\n\nThe attorney general was in Rome Monday preparing for a conference at the Vatican on human trafficking and said she was unavailable for a phone interview. In her text message responses, she did not identify which laws Aetna and UnitedHealthCare are allegedly breaking.\n\n“They are violating the contracts and have refused to provide us with \\[documents\\] we have requested,” the attorney general wrote. “United has engaged in frivolous attacks on the AGs contracting authority as well.”\n\n“They cannot expect to have a discretionary renewal when they are currently non-compliant,” Murrill said.\n\nShe indicated the state is at more of an impasse with UnitedHealthCare than Aetna. Her office is in settlement discussions with CVS, which is Aetna’s parent company, she added.\n\nIn June, Murrill [filed three lawsuits](https://lailluminator.com/2025/06/24/louisiana-sues-cvs-over-text-messages-against-pharmacy-benefit-manager-bill/) against CVS claiming its pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark, operates in ways that discourage competition, particularly from the state’s independent pharmacists.\n\nShe also alleged CVS inappropriately used customer information to launch a text message campaign to defeat state legislation that would have made it difficult for CVS Caremark to work in Louisiana. Landry, who is close to Murrill, was an enthusiastic supporter of the bill, which failed to pass.\n\nAs attorney general in 2022, Landry launched a separate lawsuit against pharmacy benefit manager OptumRx and UnitedHealthCare, which are owned by the same parent company. He alleged they overcharged the state’s Medicaid plan for prescription drugs.\n\nIn that case, which Murrill has since been taken over, the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal [recently sided with UnitedHealthCare](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/la-court-of-appeal/117959005.html) over the state.\n\nThe court’s ruling for UnitedHealthCare was released Nov. 21, the day after lawmakers signed off the company’s 2026 contract extension. A little over a week later, the health department appeared to reverse course and sent out a notice indicating they weren’t renewing the UnitedHealth agreement.\n\nThe day before the court’s decision came out, the Landry administration had recommended to lawmakers that they allow the Aetna and UnitedHealthCare contractsto  go forward.\n\nDuring a nearly three-hour hearing, Greenstein and health department undersecretary Drew Maranto, both Landry appointees, answered dozens of questions from legislators and never expressed reservations about continuing to work with Aetna or UnitedHealthCare.\n\nGreenstein even pushed back when legislators [suggested](https://lailluminator.com/2025/06/24/louisiana-sues-cvs-over-text-messages-against-pharmacy-benefit-manager-bill/) the state cut its number of Medicaid managed care contracts with private companies. Lawmakers believe working with fewer businesses could lower the administrative costs in the Medicaid program. But Greenstein cast doubt on whether those benefits would be worth the upheaval in the program.\n\n“Each of the plans brings a different way of envisioning how to engage patients with certain medical complexities,” Greenstein told legislators. “Patients don’t generally switch their health plan very often.”\n\nHis remarks are likely why several lawmakers, reached Monday, said they were blindsided when they discovered the health department had canceled the contract extensions.\n\nThe governor and the health department didn’t give the legislators advance notice before they reversed course with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare.\n\n- Posted on\nDecember 9, 8:57 am\n- Section: [Health](https://thecurrentla.com/section/health/), [News](https://thecurrentla.com/section/news-analysis/)\n- Topics: [Aetna](https://thecurrentla.com/topic/aetna/), [Bruce Greenstein](https://thecurrentla.com/topic/bruce-greenstein/), [CVS](https://thecurrentla.com/topic/cvs/), [Health](https://thecurrentla.com/topic/health/), [Insurance](https://thecurrentla.com/topic/insurance/), [Louisiana](https://thecurrentla.com/topic/louisiana/), [Medicaid](https://thecurrentla.com/topic/medicaid/), [UnitedHealth](https://thecurrentla.com/topic/unitedhealth/)\n\nAbout Julie O'Donoghue\n\nJulie O’Donoghue is a senior reporter for the Louisiana Illuminator and producer of the Louisiana Illuminator podcast.

This article is for informational purposes only and is **not** investment advice._\n\n* * *\n\n## UnitedHealth Group stock today: A blue chip in the penalty box\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE: UNH) – long considered one of the steadiest blue chips in U.S. healthcare – is ending 2025 in unfamiliar territory.\n\n- **Share price:** around **$324 per share** as of December 10, 2025.\n- **Market capitalization:** roughly **$293 billion**. [\\[1\\]](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/filing-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-shares-sold-by-federated-hermes-inc-2025-12-10/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- **52‑week range:** about **$234.60 – $606.36**, with the stock down roughly **39% over the last year**. [\\[2\\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UNH/key-statistics/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nThat’s a jarring reversal for a company that, until recently, was famed for its consistent earnings growth, rising dividend, and defensive profile.\n\nYet underneath the share-price pain, **UnitedHealth’s business is still growing**. Total revenue in the first nine months of 2025 climbed to about **$334.4 billion**, up from $299.5 billion a year ago – an increase of roughly **11–12% year over year**. [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176625000301/a2025q3exhibit991.htm?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nThe problem isn’t top line growth. It’s everything else.\n\n* * *\n\n## 2025: A year of shocks for UnitedHealth\n\nTo understand UNH stock’s slump, you have to understand the string of extraordinary events that hit the company in late 2024 and throughout 2025.\n\n### 1\\. The CEO assassination and leadership turmoil\n\nOn **December 4, 2024**, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare (UnitedHealth’s core insurance division), was **shot and killed in Midtown Manhattan** while walking to an investor meeting. [\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Brian_Thompson?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nLuigi Mangione, a former engineer, has been charged with the murder and is now at the center of a high‑profile state and federal case, with pre‑trial hearings continuing into late 2025. [\\[5\\]](https://abcnews.go.com/US/luigi-mangione-returns-court-day-4-pretrial-evidence/story?id=128206620&utm_source=ts2.tech) The killing triggered a wave of scrutiny and anger toward the U.S. health insurance industry, and UnitedHealth in particular, that still colors public and political debate.\n\nThen, in **May 2025**, **UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty abruptly stepped down**, citing personal reasons. Former longtime CEO and current chair **Stephen J. Hemsley** returned to the top job. [\\[6\\]](https://www.beckerspayer.com/leadership/unitedhealth-group-ceo-steps-down/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nThe leadership change came with a gut punch: UnitedHealth **suspended its 2025 financial outlook**, blaming surging medical costs and rising utilization in its Medicare Advantage plans. [\\[7\\]](https://apnews.com/article/78d0da7e1411138bca8c50b00a518191?utm_source=ts2.tech) The stock sold off sharply on the news.\n\n### 2\\. DOJ criminal probe into Medicare Advantage billing\n\nIn February 2025, _The Wall Street Journal_ revealed that the **U.S. Department of Justice’s criminal healthcare fraud unit** had launched an investigation into UnitedHealth’s Medicare Advantage billing practices – specifically, allegations that the company exaggerated patient diagnoses to boost risk‑adjusted payments. [\\[8\\]](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/grassley-pushes-for-answers-on-unitedhealth-groups-medicare-advantage-billing-practices?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nUnitedHealth later confirmed it was **cooperating with criminal and civil inquiries** from the DOJ and other agencies and commissioned third‑party reviews of its coding and reimbursement practices. [\\[9\\]](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2025/2025-07-24-uhg-responds-to-doj-investigation.html?utm_source=ts2.tech) No resolution has been announced, leaving a major legal and reputational overhang for investors.\n\n### 3\\. Policy shock: “One Big Beautiful Bill” and Medicaid/ACA cuts\n\nOn **July 4, 2025**, President Trump signed the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)**, the year’s budget reconciliation law. It includes **nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years** and significant reductions to Affordable Care Act subsidies, with nonpartisan estimates suggesting millions could eventually lose health coverage. [\\[10\\]](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/medicaid-cuts-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-leave-3-10-young-adults-vulnerable-losing?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nAnalysts expect these changes to pressure insurers serving low‑income populations and ACA marketplace enrollees – areas where UnitedHealth has significant exposure through its Medicaid and exchange businesses. Several policy groups highlight that the law’s changes to Medicaid eligibility and work requirements are likely to **reduce enrollment and raise uncompensated care risk**, particularly in rural and low‑income states. [\\[11\\]](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/how-will-the-2025-budget-reconciliation-affect-the-aca-medicaid-and-the-uninsured-rate/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nIn short: **volume risk + political risk** landed on UnitedHealth at the same time as its medical costs spiked.\n\n* * *\n\n## Earnings snapshot: Revenue up, margins crushed\n\nDespite the turmoil, UnitedHealth is still a revenue machine. The issue is profitability.\n\n### Second quarter 2025: Guidance re‑established, but at lower levels\n\nFor **Q2 2025** (quarter ended June 30):\n\n- **Revenue:** $111.6 billion, up from $98.9 billion a year earlier.\n- **Earnings from operations:** $5.15 billion vs. $7.88 billion in Q2 2024.\n- **GAAP EPS:** $3.74, down from $4.54.\n- **Adjusted EPS:** $4.08, down from $6.80. [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176625000228/a2025q2exhibit991.htm?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nUnitedHealth also **re‑established its 2025 outlook** after suspending guidance earlier in the year, projecting:\n\n- Revenue of **$445.5–$448 billion**\n- **Adjusted EPS “at least $16.00”**\n- A consolidated **medical care ratio (MCR) of about 89.25%** – much higher than historical levels, reflecting elevated claims costs. [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176625000228/a2025q2exhibit991.htm?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\n### Third quarter 2025: Beat estimates, but profits plunge\n\nFor **Q3 2025** (quarter ended September 30), the numbers were a classic “good headline, bad story” mix:\n\n- **Total revenue:** $113.2 billion, up from $100.8 billion in Q3 2024.\n- **Earnings from operations:** $4.32 billion, down from $8.71 billion.\n- **Net earnings attributable to shareholders:** $2.35–2.35 billion (SEC shows $2.35–2.35B; AP rounds to $2.35B), versus $6.06 billion a year earlier – a drop of about **61%**. [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176625000301/a2025q3exhibit991.htm?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- **GAAP diluted EPS:** $2.59 vs. $6.51.\n- **Adjusted EPS:** $2.92 vs. $7.15 – still **ahead of Wall Street’s consensus** around $2.87. [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176625000301/a2025q3exhibit991.htm?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- **Consolidated medical care ratio:** 89.9%, roughly **4.7 percentage points higher** year over year, reflecting heavier utilization and pricing mis‑steps earlier in the year. [\\[16\\]](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/content/dam/UHG/PDF/investors/2025/unh-reports-third-quarter-2025-results-and-raises-full-year-2025-earnings-outlook.pdf?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nUnitedHealth used the Q3 report to **raise full‑year 2025 guidance slightly**, now expecting:\n\n- **Adjusted EPS of at least $16.25** (up from $16.00)\n- GAAP EPS of at least $14.90\n- Net earnings attributable to shareholders of at least $13.6 billion. [\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176625000301/a2025q3exhibit991.htm?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nStill, the market didn’t celebrate. One post‑earnings analysis noted that UNH shares fell nearly **10% in the days after the Q3 release**, despite the earnings beat, underscoring how fragile investor confidence remains. [\\[18\\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealths-q3-beat-isnt-stopping-181600057.html?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\n* * *\n\n## Medicare Advantage: Shrinking footprint to save margins\n\nOne of the biggest stories for **2026** is UnitedHealth’s aggressive reset of its **Medicare Advantage (MA)** business.\n\n- UnitedHealth plans to **exit MA plans in 109 U.S. counties in 16 states** for 2026, affecting about **180,000 members directly**. [\\[19\\]](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/unitedhealth-exit-medicare-advantage-plans-16-us-counties-2025-10-01/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- Across various product changes, the company will **discontinue more than 100 MA plans**, primarily less tightly managed PPO options, impacting up to **600,000 members**. [\\[20\\]](https://www.risehealth.org/insights-articles/regulatory-roundup-unitedhealth-to-exit-some-ma-plans-in-2026-susan-monarez-confirmed-as-cdc-director-and-more/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- On its Q3 earnings call, management said they now project a **net decline of around 1 million MA members in 2026**, up from a prior estimate of 600,000, as they walk away from underperforming contracts and markets. [\\[21\\]](https://www.beckerspayer.com/payer/medicare-advantage/unitedhealth-projects-1-million-member-drop-in-medicare-advantage-enrollment/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nWhy such a drastic step? Several reasons:\n\n1. **Funding cuts and rule changes.** Analysts estimate that regulatory changes and risk‑adjustment tweaks will cut CMS payments to MA plans by roughly **20% in 2026 compared with 2023 levels**, even after a nominal 5% rate increase for next year. [\\[22\\]](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/medicare/insurers-scale-back-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-plans-for-2026?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n2. **Higher utilization.** Seniors have been using more outpatient care, elective procedures and supplemental benefits than UnitedHealth expected, driving up claims. [\\[23\\]](https://apnews.com/article/8916473efdf089c4906f12e82dc5dd46?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n3. **Strategic pivot to margin over volume.** UnitedHealth has been explicit that its 2026 plan is “a conservative path focused on margin growth,” not membership growth. [\\[24\\]](https://www.beckerspayer.com/payer/medicare-advantage/unitedhealth-projects-1-million-member-drop-in-medicare-advantage-enrollment/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nEven after the exits, UnitedHealthcare expects its MA plans to be available to about **94% of Medicare-eligible Americans** in 2026 and retains its position as the **largest Medicare Advantage provider** with roughly **8.4 million MA members**. [\\[25\\]](https://www.uhc.com/news-articles/newsroom/medicare-advantage-plans-2026?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nFor UNH stock, this pivot is a double‑edged sword:\n\n- **Near term:** Lower membership and noisy headlines could keep pressure on revenue growth and investor sentiment.\n- **Medium term:** If the repricing and footprint trims work, margins and earnings growth could re‑accelerate from 2026 onward.\n\n* * *\n\n## New legal risk: Opioid lawsuit hits Optum\n\nAs if the DOJ probe weren’t enough, UnitedHealth’s Optum unit is now **in the crosshairs of the opioid litigation wave**.\n\nOn **December 8, 2025**, **West Virginia filed a federal lawsuit** against UnitedHealth and its pharmacy benefit manager, **Optum**, accusing them of worsening the state’s opioid crisis. The suit claims Optum:\n\n- Conspired with other drug‑industry players to **raise opioid dosage limits**\n- Penalized clients that tried to curb opioid dispensing\n- Took **payments from manufacturers** to keep opioids on formularies and ease coverage restrictions\n- Dispensed opioids via mail‑order pharmacies with inadequate oversight. [\\[26\\]](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/west-virginia-sues-united-healthgroups-pharmacy-benefit-manager-over-opioid-2025-12-08/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nWest Virginia alleges violations of the state’s consumer‑protection law, **federal RICO statutes**, and negligence, among other claims. Optum previously paid **$20 million** to resolve similar federal allegations tied to a California mail‑order pharmacy. [\\[27\\]](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/west-virginia-sues-united-healthgroups-pharmacy-benefit-manager-over-opioid-2025-12-08/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nThis case adds another layer of **litigation and reputational risk** that investors will have to monitor alongside the DOJ investigation.\n\n* * *\n\n## Leadership reset and internal reforms\n\nUnitedHealth’s board has responded to the year’s crises with a broader leadership overhaul:\n\n- **Stephen Hemsley**, CEO from 2006–2017, returned to the role in May 2025 and remains chairman. Multiple outlets have framed his comeback as a bid to “steady the ship” after the CEO assassination, cyberattack fallout and financial mis‑steps. [\\[28\\]](https://www.beckerspayer.com/leadership/unitedhealth-group-ceo-steps-down/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- In **July 2025**, UnitedHealth announced that long‑time CFO **John Rex** will shift to a strategic advisory role, with former Elevance CFO **Wayne DeVeydt** taking over as CFO effective September 2, 2025 – another sign the board wants fresh eyes on capital allocation and risk. [\\[29\\]](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2025/2025-07-31-uhg-announces-changes-to-leadership-team.html?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nOn a June investor call, Hemsley struck a notably contrite tone:\n\n> “We are well aware we have not fulfilled your expectations or our own… We apologize for that performance and we are humbly determined to earn back your trust and your confidence.” [\\[30\\]](https://www.beckerspayer.com/payer/we-have-gotten-things-wrong-unitedhealths-new-ceo-addresses-investors/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nHe also emphasized:\n\n- More **transparent pricing and underwriting**\n- Tighter management of **Optum Health** and Medicare Advantage\n- A push toward **value‑based care and integrated tech‑enabled services** across Optum’s platforms. [\\[31\\]](https://www.beckerspayer.com/payer/we-have-gotten-things-wrong-unitedhealths-new-ceo-addresses-investors/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\n* * *\n\n## What Wall Street is saying: Analyst targets vs. technicals\n\n### Fundamental analysts: Still broadly bullish\n\nDespite the volatility, **most Wall Street analysts remain positive** on UNH:\n\n- StockAnalysis aggregates the company at an overall **“Buy” rating**, with **30 analysts** in its forecast set. For 2025 and 2026, consensus estimates call for:\n\n  - **2025 revenue:** about **$452 billion**\n  - **2026 revenue:** about **$459 billion**\n  - **2025 EPS:** around **$16.47**\n  - **2026 EPS:** around **$17.89**, implying **high‑single‑digit earnings growth** as repricing kicks in. [\\[32\\]](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/unh/forecast/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- TipRanks data compiled over the last three months shows **21 analysts** rating UNH **“Strong Buy”**, with an **average 12‑month price target near $394**, a **high target around $440** and a low around $260. That implies about **20–25% upside** from today’s price. [\\[33\\]](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/unh/forecast?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- MarketBeat, summarizing 29 research firms, finds **17 Buy, 9 Hold and 3 Sell** ratings, with a **consensus target price of $385.54** – roughly in line with other sources. [\\[34\\]](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/filing-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-shares-sold-by-federated-hermes-inc-2025-12-10/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nIn other words, the **fundamental analyst community largely sees UNH as undervalued**, assuming management can deliver on the 2026–2027 earnings ramp and resolve key legal and policy overhangs.\n\n### Dividend and valuation snapshot\n\nAccording to recent filings and market data:\n\n- **Quarterly dividend:** $2.21 per share, or **$8.84 annualized**, giving UNH a **dividend yield of about 2.7%** at current prices. [\\[35\\]](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/filing-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-shares-sold-by-federated-hermes-inc-2025-12-10/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- **P/E ratio:** around **16.9x** trailing earnings – below many estimates of its long‑term average multiple and below the broader S&P 500’s current valuation. [\\[36\\]](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/filing-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-shares-sold-by-federated-hermes-inc-2025-12-10/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n- **Institutional ownership:** roughly **88%** of shares are held by institutions and hedge funds. [\\[37\\]](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/filing-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-shares-sold-by-federated-hermes-inc-2025-12-10/?utm_source=ts2.tech)\n\nSome independent analysis platforms go even further. One recent deep‑dive argued that UNH’s present valuation offers a “high margin of safety,” noting the stock trades near **17x earnings vs. an estimated 10‑year average around 22x**, while Optum’s higher‑margin businesses continue to expand. [\\[38\\]](https://www.tradingkey.com/analysis/stocks/us-stocks/251347756-unitedhealth-unh-mcr-brian-thompson-wsj-bill-buffett-tradingkey?utm_source=ts2.tech) That view, however, is an opinion – not a universal consensus.\n\n### Technical and algorithmic forecasts: A more cautious tone\n\nTechnical‑analysis sites paint a more mixed picture:\n\n- One popular technical dashboard currently rates UNH a **“Strong Sell”** on short‑term indicators (moving averages, momentum oscillators), with most signals skewed bearish after the sharp drawdown and recent sideways trading.\n- The same platform’s **long‑term algorithmic model** is wildly optimistic, projecting an average UNH price around **$703 in 2026** and **$844 in 2027** – more than **100–150% above** today’s level – based on extrapolated growth and volatility patterns.\n\nThose machine‑generated forecasts should be treated with **extreme caution**: they’re not the same as fundamental analyst estimates and can swing dramatically with new data.\n\n* * *\n\n## Fresh December 10, 2025 headlines investors are watching\n\nAs of **December 10, 2025**, several new developments are shaping the short‑term narrative around UNH stock:\n\n- **Institutional rotation.** A new MarketBeat summary of SEC filings shows **Federated Hermes cut its UNH stake by 42%** in Q2 2025, while other major investors – including Wellington Management, Dodge & Cox and Norges Bank – **increased or initiated sizeable positions**. Overall institutional ownership remains very high at ~87.9%.\n- **Stock performance context.** MarketBeat also notes UNH’s **12‑month low at $234.60 and high at $606.36**, with the shares trading near the lower third of that range.\n- **Ongoing public focus on the CEO killing case.** New coverage of the Luigi Mangione trial and related media commentary keeps UnitedHealth’s name in the headlines in a very non‑financial context, which can add reputational noise even if it doesn’t move earnings directly.\n\nCombined with the West Virginia opioid lawsuit filed on December 8, the result is a **headline‑heavy environment** around UNH – something momentum traders often dislike, even as long‑term investors sift for bargains.\n\n* * *\n\n## 2026–2027 outlook: What has to go right for a rebound?\n\nLooking ahead, the **bullish case** for UNH stock in 2026–2027 generally rests on a few key points:\n\n1. **Margin recovery as pricing resets.**\n\nManagement has already raised premiums and is resetting coverage in unprofitable segments. On the Q3 call, Hemsley said repricing within UnitedHealthcare is “on track to drive solid operating earnings growth from margin improvement within that business in 2026.”\n2. **Optum’s long‑term growth engine.**\n\nOptum (care delivery, pharmacy services, data/technology) remains a core growth driver, with segment revenue still rising even as operating margins compressed in 2025. If management can stabilize Optum Health and continue scaling Optum Rx and Optum Insight, earnings leverage could re‑emerge.\n3. **Demographic tailwinds.**\n\nThe aging U.S. population and rising healthcare spending continue to favor large, integrated players that can manage risk and costs across insurance and care delivery. Several value‑oriented analyses argue that, over a long enough horizon, **current controversies are “temporary headwinds” against structural tailwinds**.\n4. **Analyst expectations already reset.**\n\nWall Street’s EPS forecasts for 2025–2026 are far below pre‑crisis trajectories, meaning expectations for growth are **modest but positive**. If UnitedHealth merely hits or modestly beats these numbers, the multiple could expand from today’s discounted level.\n\nOn the other hand, the **bear case** argues that:\n\n- **Legal risks** (DOJ criminal probe, opioid litigation, possible follow‑on suits) could lead to **large fines, remediation costs, or structural changes** in the MA business.\n- **Policy risks** from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act may **erode Medicaid and ACA enrollment** more quickly than UnitedHealth can shift its product mix, pressuring margins and top line in public‑programs segments.\n- **Reputational damage** from the CEO killing, and social‑media narratives around denied claims and corporate greed, could eventually influence regulators, juries or future legislation in ways that hurt profits.\n\nPut simply, **UNH in 2025 is no longer the “boring compounder” it once appeared to be**. It’s a high‑quality franchise facing very real political, legal and operating risks.\n\n* * *\n\n## Key risks to monitor\n\nFor anyone tracking UnitedHealth Group stock going into 2026, the main watch‑items are:\n\n- **Outcome and scope of the DOJ Medicare Advantage investigation**\n- **Progress and potential settlements in opioid‑related litigation involving Optum**\n- **Implementation effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act** on Medicaid and ACA populations\n- **Actual 2026 Medicare Advantage membership and margin trends** vs. guidance\n- **Any further management turnover** or board changes\n- **Regulatory action** on prior‑authorization, network adequacy, risk adjustment, and PBM practices\n\nEach of these could materially move both earnings and the stock’s valuation multiple.\n\n* * *\n\n## Bottom line\n\nUnitedHealth Group enters 2026 as **one of the most complex large‑cap stories in the market**:\n\n- The **business is still growing**, with double‑digit revenue increases and a sizable global footprint.\n- The **stock is down roughly 40% over 12 months**, trading at a below‑market P/E multiple and offering a near‑3% dividend yield.\n- **Wall Street analysts, on balance, see upside**, with price targets implying mid‑teens to mid‑20s percentage gains over the next year if execution improves.\n- At the same time, **legal, policy, and reputational risks are unusually high**, and 2026 will be a stress test of UnitedHealth’s ability to reprice, restructure and regain trust.\n\nFor investors, UNH is no longer a simple “set‑and‑forget” healthcare giant. It’s a **risk‑reward trade‑off** that depends heavily on your view of:\n\n- How quickly margins can normalize\n- How severe regulatory and legal outcomes will be\n- Whether management’s new strategy truly aligns profit with sustainable, equitable care.\n\n#### References\n\n1\\.

UnitedHealth Group Inc?\n\nby [Benzinga Insights](https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-insights)Benzinga Staff Writer\n\nFollow\n\n[Find on Twitter](https://twitter.com/benzinga)\n\n[![UNH Logo](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nUNHUnitedHealth Group Inc\\\\\n\\\\\n$325.020.44%](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/UNH)\n\n[Overview](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/UNH)\n\n**UnitedHealth Group Inc's** (NYSE: [UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/UNH)) short interest as a percent of float has risen 5.15% since its last report. According to exchange reported data, there are now **12.94 million shares sold short**, which is 1.43% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, **it would take traders 1.81 days to cover their short positions on average.**\n\n### Why Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. [Short selling](https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock?adType=benzinga-insights&ad=short-interest&campaign=wallstreetadvantage) is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\n**See Also:** [**List of the most shorted stocks**](https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest?adType=benzinga-insights&ad=short-interest&campaign=wallstreetadvantage)\n\n### UnitedHealth Group Inc Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for UnitedHealth Group Inc has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\n### Comparing UnitedHealth Group Inc's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to [Benzinga Pro](https://www.benzinga.com/pro/), UnitedHealth Group Inc's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 6.67%, which means the company has **less** short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be **bullish** for a stock?

(WBOY) — Amid the fallout of the statewide opioid crisis, West Virginia is taking [another swing at the pharmaceutical industry.](https://www.wboy.com/news/national/ap-purdue-pharma-owners-could-pay-7-4-billion-in-new-settlement-to-lawsuits-over-the-toll-of-oxycontin/)\n\nIn a release on Monday, West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey announced that the state has filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of West Virginia against UnitedHealthcare, specifically its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), for its role in the opioid crisis.\n\nThe suit alleges that the PBM, known as Optum, as well as its affiliated companies, contributed to the large-scale oversupply of opioids in West Virginia.\n\n“Optum played a key role in the man-made medical crisis that destroyed countless lives and decimated our state,” Attorney General McCuskey said. “When Optum came into West Virginia around 2010, it knew the toll that opioids were exacting on West Virginia families and communities. We called it a crisis. Optum saw a business opportunity. And in its greed, Optum chose to make things worse. It is time that Optum, whose critical role was previously unknown, is held accountable.”\n\nAG McCuskey claims that in the midst of the opioid crisis, Optum was “not only ramping up the flood of pills coming into West Virginia, but actively obstructing safeguards meant to save West Virginian lives,” according to the release. The suit also alleges that Optum conspired with drug manufacturers to push “phony science” that claimed opioids were safe and non-addictive.\n\nTo add to this, the suit also alleges that Optum actively penalized clients who tried to place dispensing restrictions on opioids and created a “Pay to avoid PA” (Prior Authorization) program that allowed customers to skip these restrictions for an additional fee.\n\nThe suit also alleges that Optum’s position at the center of the opioid crisis provided it with first-hand data that gave insight into how opioids affect patients and that, rather than using that data to curb abuse, Optum instead sold it to manufacturers in order to boost sales.\n\n“As we always do, before we filed this suit, Optum was given a fair opportunity to take responsibility for its choices. Optum refused. My office will hold Optum accountable, along with anyone who helped kill West Virginians with deadly opioids. It’s impossible to put a price on the life of even one of my fellow Mountaineers, but our investigation shows that Optum caused billions of dollars of harm nationwide, and West Virginia will get what it is due,” McCuskey said.\n\nYou can read the full lawsuit below:\n\n[25 12 08 West Virginia v.

By expanding its rental, leasing and maintenance footprint in South Atlanta’s logistics corridor, the company is directly addressing rising demand from e-commerce, manufacturing and regional distribution customers. Following closely on its Nashville-area opening, this move reinforces Ryder’s commitment to scaling in high-growth freight markets.\n\nThe new facility boosts R’s service capabilities with five drive-through maintenance bays and RyderGyde technology for real-time fleet visibility and shop status updates. By combining physical infrastructure with digital fleet intelligence, Ryder is improving vehicle uptime, service efficiency and customer experience. This tech-enabled approach strengthens the company’s competitive positioning and supports higher-value, recurring service relationships.\n\nMcDonough’s rapid emergence as an inland port and logistics hub further enhances the strategic impact of this investment. With direct connectivity to Atlanta and the expanding Port of Savannah, the region continues to attract industrial and distribution activity that fuels demand for fleet services. By adding jobs and expanding local service capacity, Ryder is positioning itself to capture long-term growth from Georgia’s fast-growing $83 billion logistics economy.\n\n## R Share Price Performance\n\nDriven by such innovative efforts, shares of R have gained 39.3% over the past year, outperforming the 7.6% growth of its Zacks [Transportation - Equipment and Leasing](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-rank/industry/transportation-equipment-and-leasing-188) industry.\n\n![Zacks Investment Research](https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9e/135357.jpg?v=2011585062)\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n## R’s Zacks Rank\n\nRyder System currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\n## Stocks to Consider\n\nInvestors interested in the Zacks [Transportation](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-rank/sector/transportation-15) sector may consider **Expeditors International of Washington** (EXPD Quick Quote [EXPD](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/EXPD?art_rec=blog-analyst_blog-commentary_body-ticker-ticker-EXPD) \\- [Free Report](https://www.zacks.com/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=zrmodule&mode=zramodule&t=EXPD&ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK_ANALYSTBLOG_257_2800188_EXPD&icid=BLOG-Analyst_Blog|Company_News_-_Corporate_Actions-2800188-free_report-commentary_body-text-EXPD \"Free Report\")) and **SkyWest**(SKYW Quick Quote [SKYW](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/SKYW?art_rec=blog-analyst_blog-commentary_body-ticker-ticker-SKYW) \\- [Free Report](https://www.zacks.com/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=zrmodule&mode=zramodule&t=SKYW&ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK_ANALYSTBLOG_257_2800188_SKYW&icid=BLOG-Analyst_Blog|Company_News_-_Corporate_Actions-2800188-free_report-commentary_body-text-SKYW \"Free Report\")) .\n\n**EXPD** currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

These [30 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/global?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=intro&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4262311). The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.\n\n## Ryder System Investment Narrative Recap\n\nTo own Ryder, you need to believe in its ability to compound value through contract logistics, disciplined capital allocation, and steady, U.S.-centric freight demand, while managing a capital-heavy truck fleet and used vehicle exposure. The McDonough expansion fits the existing port-to-door story but does not materially change the near term catalyst, which still centers on improving supply chain and dedicated contract wins, or the key risk of depressed used vehicle pricing and freight softness.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement alongside this Georgia build-out is Ryder’s continued focus on tuck-in M&A in supply chain and dedicated transport, including health care logistics and returns packaging. Together, these moves speak to a consistent effort to deepen contract-based, asset-light services, which may help counterbalance cyclical freight and used equipment pressures if Ryder can keep growing its higher margin, recurring revenue streams without stretching its already intensive capital needs.\n\nYet even as Ryder expands in high growth corridors, investors should be aware that prolonged weakness in used vehicle pricing could...\n\n[Read the full narrative on Ryder System (it's free!)](https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/transportation/nyse-r/ryder-system/vmo8bs4c-analysts-raise-ryder-system-price-target-as-profit-margins-improve-and-expansion-continues?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4262311)\n\nRyder System's narrative projects $14.4 billion revenue and $657.9 million earnings by 2028. This requires 4.4% yearly revenue growth and about a $153.9 million earnings increase from $504.0 million today.\n\n[Uncover how Ryder System's forecasts yield a $201.33 fair value](https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/transportation/nyse-r/ryder-system/vmo8bs4c-analysts-raise-ryder-system-price-target-as-profit-margins-improve-and-expansion-continues?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4262311), a 12% upside to its current price.\n\n## Exploring Other Perspectives\n\n[![R Community Fair Values as at Dec 2025](<Base64-Image-Removed>)](https://simplywall.st/company/id/818695ff-85a7-4017-aa87-7fd9c6e022fe?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=4262311)\n\nR Community Fair Values as at Dec 2025\n\nTwo fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community cluster between US$201 and US$219, hinting at a relatively tight spread in expectations.

That additional liquidity sits alongside the company’s focus on asset light supply chain and dedicated solutions, which many investors view as central to Ryder’s effort to grow recurring revenue and improve margin resilience over time.\n\nYet even as Ryder pushes into higher value logistics, investors should be aware that prolonged freight downturns and cautious customers could still...\n\n[Read the full narrative on Ryder System (it's free!)](https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/transportation/nyse-r/ryder-system/vmo8bs4c-analysts-raise-ryder-system-price-target-as-profit-margins-improve-and-expansion-continues)\n\nRyder System's narrative projects $14.4 billion revenue and $657.9 million earnings by 2028.

The annual reviews are a chance for board members to run a post-mortem on the year prior, talk about the year to come, and preview the three-year strategic outlook so directors can kick the tires on Ryder’s plans.\n\n“It’s a great time for the board members to really pressure test our strategy and think about it in different ways,” said Sanchez, who previously served as the chief financial officer, chief operating officer and chief information officer at Ryder, which generated $12.6 billion in revenues last [year](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/85961/000008596125000032/r-20241231.htm). “We almost view it as an annual toll gate where we sit with them and say, ‘All right, here are the things that we told you we were going to do last year. Here’s what we got accomplished, and here are the new things we want to get done.’”\n\nIt was at an annual strategy session, Sanchez told _Fortune_, that one of the most illuminating moments emerged. Sanchez and the other senior executives were talking about market share in the truck leasing and rental business known as Fleet Management Solutions, while the board members listened. At the time, Ryder held 35% to 40% of the truck leasing market segment—nothing to sneeze at.\n\n“We felt pretty good,” said Sanchez.\n\nAnd then one board member from a completely different industry raised his hand to ask a question that would ultimately become a hugely pivotal moment for Sanchez and his team and Ryder.\n\n“Does that mean that 40% of the trucks that are on the road are from Ryder?” the director asked.\n\n“And I said, ‘Well, no, of course not,’” Sanchez recalled. “Then he goes, ‘Why is that? What do all the other truck owners do? Are they leasing from somebody else? Are they getting dedicated service from somebody else?’”\n\n“No,” Sanchez told the director; other operators on the road probably buy their own trucks and have their own drivers. The director asked Sanchez point blank: “Why aren’t you guys going after them?”\n\n“So, we all kind of stared at each other and said, ‘We’ll have to get back to you,’” Sanchez recounted.\n\nFor context, the leasing market at the time was only 15% to 20% of all the trucks on the road. Meaning, 80% to 85% purchased and maintained their own trucks. So the big takeaway was really about why Ryder wasn’t going after _that_ truck ownership market—the 80% to 85%. So for a full year afterward, Sanchez and his team strategized how to chip away at all the companies that don’t lease trucks from Ryder or any of its competitors, nor outsource transportation to them.\n\n“We realized that a large percentage of the market is do-it-yourselfers,” said Ryder. “So our strategy over the last probably 12 to 13 years has been chipping away at the do-it-yourself market when it comes to trucking and transportation.”\n\nThe independent director who asked the question? His background is in office supplies and has nothing to do with trucking. But he asked the question that crystallized a strategic insight that helped push more than a decade of execution.\n\nIn hindsight, “it was pretty obvious,” said Sanchez. “But as a company that’s been around for 80 years, we really hadn’t looked at it that way.”\n\ncontent frame\n\n**An error has occurred**\n\n## CEO Daily Newsletter\n\nStart your day with our five-minute briefing on the news, trends, and chatter shaping business.\n\nEmail address:\n\nBy creating an account, I have read and agreed to Fortune's [Terms of Use](https://fortune.com/terms-of-use/?_ptid=%7Bkpdx%7DAAAAsXMc-DjzdQoKY2ZRajJmTTN6ahIQbWowbWd6aDFtOHZ1eWloZRoMRVhaUlc5SkNCQzNYIiUxODA3aXQwMGJvLTAwMDAzNm9hZ3VmaTRwaHZzdHE4c2kzb2YwKhtzaG93VGVtcGxhdGUxSDhPNThKMkhMUk5MSjQwAToMT1RQUkZDWlMyQ1VaUhJ2LXYA8Bc2d25kdno1aTNaDDUuMTgzLjkxLjE2MGIDZGxjaNqe7ckGcAN4BA) and [Privacy Policy](https://fortune.com/privacy-policy/?_ptid=%7Bkpdx%7DAAAAsXMc-DjzdQoKY2ZRajJmTTN6ahIQbWowbWd6aDFtOHZ1eWloZRoMRVhaUlc5SkNCQzNYIiUxODA3aXQwMGJvLTAwMDAzNm9hZ3VmaTRwaHZzdHE4c2kzb2YwKhtzaG93VGVtcGxhdGUxSDhPNThKMkhMUk5MSjQwAToMT1RQUkZDWlMyQ1VaUhJ2LXYA8Bc2d25kdno1aTNaDDUuMTgzLjkxLjE2MGIDZGxjaNqe7ckGcAN4BA).\n\nSign up\n\nThank you for subscribing to our newsletter!\n\n**Join us at the Fortune Workplace Innovation Summit** May 19–20, 2026, in Atlanta.

Griffin quit golf four years ago before joining The Tour in 2023.\n\n“Best weekend of my life,” Myeroff gushed on Instagram Tuesday.\n\nIt’s been a year Myeroff and Griffin will forever remember.\n\n[![Ben Griffin won the Charles Schwab Challenge, his first solo PGA Tour triumph, in May 2025.](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ben-griffin-fianc-dana-myeroff-111971912.jpg?w=1024)4](https://nypost.com/2025/12/09/sports/rising-pga-tour-star-ben-griffin-marries-dana-myeroff-in-palm-beach/# \"Open a slideshow of all 4 article images.\")\n\nBen Griffin won the Charles Schwab Challenge, his first solo PGA Tour triumph, in May 2025.

IMAGN IMAGES via Reuters\n\nThe North Carolina native secured his first-ever PGA Tour win alongside fellow American Andrew Novak at the Zurich Classic in April. He went on to capture his first solo victory a month later at the Charles Schwab Challenge.\n\n“It’s hard to put into words what it’s like to watch the person you love most achieve their childhood dreams,” Myeroff shared on social media in May. “I am so proud of you Ben and the journey it took to get here. Turns out your dream coming true is my dream too.”\n\nWhat do you think? [Post a comment.](https://nypost.com/2025/12/09/sports/rising-pga-tour-star-ben-griffin-marries-dana-myeroff-in-palm-beach/#spotim-specific)\n\nAs his play excelled, Griffin [ultimately cracked captain Keegan Bradley’s lineup](https://nypost.com/2025/08/27/sports/ryder-cup-live-updates-keegan-bradley-announces-team-usa-captains-picks/) for Team USA at this year’s Ryder Cup.\n\nWeeks after Team Europe’s triumph at Bethpage Black, Griffin sealed his third PGA victory at the World Wide Technology Championship in November.\n\nHe’s currently ranked ninth in the world.\n\n![conversation-loading](https://static-cdn.spot.im/production/social/tags/RC-v5.18.0/launcher/ec24cb303220fcfc94f8.svg)"

White claims that Ngannou pushed him in his office and later grabbed Hunter Campbell by the back of the shirt.\n\n## Add MMA Fighting on Google\n\nAdd MMA Fighting as a preferred source to see more of our reporting on Google.\n\n[Add us on Google](https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=mmafighting.com)\n\nGiven the inflammatory nature of White’s comments, one might expect Ngannou to offer a vociferous defense of himself; however, when speaking with [Ariel Helwani on Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2or8aNYuOsg), Ngannou seemed mostly unperturbed by the whole thing.\n\n“Why am I not surprised?” Ngannou said.\n\n“… At some point, it feels very annoying to just have to be responsible of what people say. Basically, if Dana says this, then I’m out here to defend myself of what Dana said, or whoever. I think, whatever he said, if he’s at peace with it, it’s OK. …\n\n“No, I don’t find it important \\[to respond\\]. I don’t find it necessary. At some point it was, but over time, it’s not anymore. Maybe I’m getting old. I have less energy for drama or for stuff. I just want to be at peace, and for people to leave me alone. That’s all.”\n\nEven when pressed to offer an outright rebuttal of what happened, Ngannou wasn’t willing to dive into another back-and-forth with White.\n\n“In his office, that’s what he said, right?” Ngannou said. “Well, I’m sure he has a lot of cameras there. …\n\n“If every time that somebody says something about you, that you have \\[respond\\], it’s going to be tough. As I said, over time, I just get tired of that stuff. I really saw that and scrolled \\[past\\]. I get past it. I wasn’t even thinking — I should’ve been thinking you were going to ask me that, obviously, but I’m long gone from that.”\n\nNgannou has not fought for the UFC in almost four years. His last bout was his heavyweight title defense against Ciryl Gane at UFC 270. Following that, “The Predator” spent a year recovering from a knee injury before leaving the promotion to sign with PFL. Even when he was still under contract with the UFC, White and Ngannou had an up-and-down relationship, which only soured once Ngannou left, which Ngannou says left him disappointed with where this all ended up.\n\n“We shouldn’t have gone this way,” Ngannou said of his relationship with the UFC and White. “Why do we get all this way, first of all? What’s the purpose? How did we get from where we were to where we are right now? And I would just say, quite disappointing the way things went.”\n\n[17 Comments](https://www.mmafighting.com/latest-news/460956/francis-ngannou-reacts-to-alleged-dana-white-altercation-im-sure-he-has-a-lot-of-cameras#comments)\n\nSee More:\n\n- [Latest News](https://www.mmafighting.com/latest-news)\n- [UFC](https://www.mmafighting.com/ufc)\n- [UFC News](https://www.mmafighting.com/ufc-news)\n\n## Active Articles\n\n🔥 Ranked by most activity in the last 24 hours.\n\n1.

Rumors of a Rousey return have been circulating for a while after videos of her training emerged earlier this year.\n\nHowever, the UFC boss calls shenanigans.\n\n\"Total bullsh\\*t,\" White told MMA Junkie and other reporters during the UFC 323 post-fight news conference.\n\nRousey, a former UFC women's bantamweight champion, hasn't competed in combat sports since [losing to Amanda Nunes](https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/story/sports/ufc/2016/12/31/ufc-207-results-amanda-nunes-blasts-ronda-rousey-for-48-second-tko-1/82300757007/) by first-round TKO in December 2016. White doesn't even see Rousey making an octagon return but clarified that his reaction isn't a shot at the 38-year-old.\n\n\"That's up to her, you know what I mean?\" White said of Rousey returning. \"I personally cannot say enough good things about Ronda Rousey. When she was going to the WWE, the WWE called me to ask. I said, 'I'm telling you right now, she'll be the greatest athlete you've ever worked with over there. I'm telling you.' I can't say enough good things about her. She was great when she was here.\"\n\n[Share to Twitter](https://x.com/intent/post?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmmajunkie.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fufc%2F2025%2F12%2F09%2Fdana-white-ronda-rousey-boxing-katie-taylor-fake-news%2F87682794007%2F&text=Dana%20White%3A%20Ronda%20Rousey%20boxing%20Katie%20Taylor%20is%20%27total%20bullsh*t%27&via=MMAJunkie)[Share by email](mailto:?subject=Dana%20White%3A%20Ronda%20Rousey%20boxing%20Katie%20Taylor%20is%20%27total%20bullsh*t%27%20-%20from%20MMA%20Junkie&body=Dana%20White%3A%20Ronda%20Rousey%20boxing%20Katie%20Taylor%20is%20%27total%20bullsh*t%27%0A%0ADana%20White%20is%20not%20buying%20the%20talk%20of%20Ronda%20Rousey%20competing%20in%20boxing%20for%20her%20return%20to%20combat%20sports.%0A%0ACheck%20out%20this%20story%20on%20mmajunkie.usatoday.com%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fmmajunkie.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fufc%2F2025%2F12%2F09%2Fdana-white-ronda-rousey-boxing-katie-taylor-fake-news%2F87682794007%2F)\n\n[We're always working to improve your experience.

And that’s because there are only a few left.\n\nPublix officials told News 6 that the scales’ manufacturer — Mettler Toledo — stopped making them a few years ago.\n\n“The manufacturer ceased production in 2015, meaning that one day — although our wonderful repair shop keeps our remaining machines in great shape — the last Publix scale will retire,” Publix wrote. “When scales are taken out of a store, they go for a spruce-up in our repair shop. They could wind up going to another store, or they may be held for parts to utilize in other scales.”\n\nNo description found\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_scale,w_900/v1/media/gmg/NSBWYKMUX5FCHNPEVI32PU4ANU.jpg?_a=DAJHqpE+ZAAA)\n\nAs a result, these scales won’t be coming to new Florida stores, the company explained.\n\nPublix bought up as many of these scales as it could before Mettler Toledo stopped production, and the remaining scales are kept in stores or at a warehouse in Lakeland.\n\n**\\[BELOW: Welcome to Florida’s first-ever Publix store\\]**\n\n1\n\n/\n\n20\n\nWelcome to Florida's first-ever Publix store.

While many retailers are scaling back their operations, this type of supermarket seems to be stepping on the gas… at least in South Carolina and Florida.\n\n## Publix openings in December 2025\n\nThis month alone, Publix has officially confirmed the opening of three supercenters at the following addresses:\n\n- Daniel Island, South Carolina (162 Seven Farms Drive).\n- Aiken, South Carolina (1535 Silver Bluff Road).\n- Jacksonville, Florida (9964 Old Baymeadows Road).\n\nThe Daniel Island Publix opened on December 3. It has an area of more than 50,000 square feet and represents the highest standard of luxury for the supermarket chain. The Aiken Publix opened three days later and also has approximately 47,000 square feet of retail space.\n\nThe Publix supermarket in Jacksonville, FL will open on December 11. However, it’s not all good news; to the sadness of many residents of Atlanta, Georgia, the iconic Atlantic Station store will close its doors permanently on December 27, so we’ll be able to do our Christmas dinner shopping there one last time.\n\n## Publix from its beginnings\n\nThe long history of the Publix 3930 supermarket chain began with a man named George Jenkins, who has gone down in corporate history simply as “Mr. George.” At that time, Jenkins was an ambitious young man who ran a Piggly Wiggly store in Winter Haven, Florida. He had many innovative ideas up his sleeve, so he traveled to Atlanta to meet with the owner of his chain of stores and propose improvements to the business.\n\nHowever, he was left disappointed, as the chain owner did not even grant him an audience. According to corporate legend, the businessman was too busy playing golf to care about a simple small-town manager. Deeply insulted but equally motivated, Jenkins returned to Florida and made a radical decision: he quit his job, took his savings of $1,300 (a fortune during the Great Depression) and started his own store.\n\nHe was ambitious, but he wasn’t going to let his former boss get away with it. To add insult to injury, he opened his first store right next door to his former boss. Jenkins chose the name “Publix” after seeing it on a bankrupt movie theater chain. It sounded great—almost majestic—so he decided to take the name. He did well, but soon left the small grocery stores behind and decided to build his “dreamland,” a veritable palace of food that was much larger.\n\nWhen we think of supermarkets in the 1950s, Rivas brings to mind a supermarket other than Publix. It was the first supermarket in the area to have air conditioning, which was crucial for surviving Florida’s brutal heat. It was one of the first to install automatic doors and fluorescent lights that made the products shine like jewels. That spirit of innovation helped the business thrive for decades. What started as a small store next to its competition has ended up becoming an empire of 1,466 stores.\n\nUnlike its national competitors, Publix has remained true to its roots and operates strictly in eight southeastern states.\n\n## Publix vibes\n\nThe company’s slogan is “w _here shopping is a pleasure,_” and they do everything they can to make that true. The thing that stands out most is the cleanliness. Their terrazzo floors are so polished that anyone would think they were wet. The smell is not industrial disinfectant, but a mixture of freshly baked bread and comforting fried chicken.\n\nBut Publix’s real success isn’t the retail space, it’s the people. It’s the largest employee-owned company in the United States. This means that both the person who cuts your ham at the deli counter and the person who rings up your purchase probably own shares in the company. They have a direct financial incentive to be friendly and efficient, and it shows in the way they treat you.\n\nIf you’ve never been to a Publix and one has just opened near your home, take the opportunity to check it out… You’re sure to be pleasantly surprised and find a new favorite supermarket!\n\n[Search Button](https://eladelantado.com/en/publix-florida-south-carolina/#)\n\n- [Home](https://eladelantado.com/en/)\n- [Economy](https://eladelantado.com/en/economy/)\n- [Mobility](https://eladelantado.com/en/mobility/)\n- [News](https://eladelantado.com/en/news/)\n- [Science](https://eladelantado.com/en/science/)\n- [Technology](https://eladelantado.com/en/technology/)\n- [El Adelantado](https://eladelantado.com/)\n\n[Find us on Facebook](https://facebook.com/)[Find us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/)[Find us on Youtube](https://youtube.com/)\n\n© 2025 - El Adelantado de Segovia"

We remain committed to continuing Publix founder George Jenkins’ legacy by doing good, together.”\n\nRenee Snyder, president and CEO of Habitat for Humanity Sarasota in Florida, said, “Publix Super Markets Charities understands the need in our community for affordable housing. Their substantial and continued investment in our homeownership program year after year creates generational change.

The money is very, very clear,\" he said, adding that BlackRock is focused on what he called a \"traditional picks and shovels capex super boom, which still feels like it's got more to go.\"\n\nAI infrastructure has been one of the biggest drivers of global investment this year, fueling a broader market rally, even as some investors question [how long the boom can last](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble.html).\n\nNvidia, whose GPU chips are the backbone of the AI revolution, became [the first company to briefly surpass $5 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-historic-5-trillion-valuation-amid-ai-rally.html) in market capitalization amid a dizzying AI-fueled market rally that sparked talk of an AI bubble.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI also reached a restructuring deal in October to support [the ChatGPT developer's fundraising efforts](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-reach-new-deal-allow-openai-restructure-2025-10-28/). OpenAI has reportedly been preparing for an initial public offering that could [value the company at $1 trillion](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/), according to Reuters.\n\nThe build-out has set off long-term procurement efforts across the tech sector, from chip supply agreements to power commitments. Grid operators from the U.S. to the Middle East are racing to meet soaring electricity demand from new data centers. Companies, including Amazon and Meta, have budgeted [tens of billions of dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/amazon-to-spend-up-to-50-billion-on-ai-services-for-us-government.html) annually for AI-related investments.\n\nS&P Global estimates data-center power demand could nearly [double by 2030](https://www.spglobal.com/energy/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/110525-global-data-center-power-demand-expected-to-almost-double-by-2030), mostly driven by hyperscale, enterprise and leased facilities, along with crypto-mining sites.\n\n## 'Dipping toes into credit market'\n\nPowell also noted that leading tech firms have only begun to tap capital markets to fund the next phase of AI expansion, suggesting additional capital is on the way.\n\n![Blackrock's Powell on bubble fears: More tailwinds than headwinds in AI cycle](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108238082-17651738811765173878-42879323106-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1765173881&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:3410:34\n\nBlackrock's Powell on bubble fears: More tailwinds than headwinds in AI\n\n[Access Middle East](https://www.cnbc.com/access-middle-east/)\n\n\"The big companies have only just started dipping their toes into the credit markets… feels like there's a lot more they can do there,\" he said.\n\nThe \"hyperscalers\" are behaving as if coming second would effectively leave them out of the market, Powell said. That mindset, he added, has pushed firms to accelerate spending even at the risk of overshooting.\n\nMuch of that capital, Powell noted, is likely to flow to the companies powering the AI build-out rather than model developers, reinforcing a growing view among global investors that the most durable gains from the AI boom may lie in the hardware, energy and infrastructure ecosystems behind the technology.\n\n\"If we're the recipients of that cash flow, I guess that's a pretty good place to be, whether you're making chips, whether you're making energy all the way down to the copper wiring,\" Powell noted, expecting \"positive surprises driving those stocks in the year ahead.\""

YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - BlackRock is on track for record annual inflows into its iShares products this year and for one of its strongest years for organic base-fee growth, Chief Financial Officer Martin Small said on Tuesday.\n\nAs of Dec. 5, BlackRock's iShares exchange traded funds (ETFs) registered inflows of about $100 billion in the fourth quarter this year, said Small, bringing iShares flows to a total of about $450 billion this year, which would be an annual record.\n\nSign up

in BlackRock is very excited about delivering one of the strongest years in terms of organic base fee growth that we've seen in the history of the company,\" Small said, speaking at the 2025 Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference.\n\nOrganic base fee growth is a measure of management fee revenue excluding acquisitions and other one-off effects.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager, with more than $13 trillion under its watch by the end of the third quarter, has been bulking up in private markets through acquisitions last year that were key to its ambition to become a one-stop investment shop for both public and private assets.\n\nIt expects its push into private markets will help [drive revenue](https://www.reuters.com/business/private-market-push-focus-blackrock-hosts-investor-day-2025-06-12/) and boost its market value in the years ahead.\n\n\"We're really seeing a lot of breadth in the business in terms of growth engines,\" said Small. \"It's not just capabilities that we've had for decades, it's new capabilities that we've built in the last two years, as well as capabilities that we've acquired in the last two years,\" he said.\n\nReporting by Davide Barbuscia, Editing by Nick Zieminski\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new

But the average investor earned just 11% annualized over the same period, according to new analysis by Morningstar. Much of that disconnect owes to poor timing: many investors piled in only after the fund had already surged — underscoring how market timing can blunt even the best-performing products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n- [Wealthy County in New York Must Pay $112 Million Over Immigrant Rights Violations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/suffolk-county-home-of-hamptons-hit-with-112-million-payout-to-detainees?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n- [A Bright Idea for Road Safety: Traffic Light Timing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/how-do-traffic-lights-curb-dangerous-driving-it-s-all-in-the-timing?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n- [Trump Replaces Architect to Lead $300 Million Ballroom Design](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/trump-replaces-architect-to-lead-300-million-ballroom-design?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n- [NJ Suburb Montclair Goes Through With School-System Staff Cuts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/nj-suburb-montclair-goes-through-with-school-system-staff-cuts?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n- [Owner of NYC’s Fordham Landing Housing Project Files Bankruptcy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/owner-of-nyc-s-fordham-landing-housing-project-files-bankruptcy?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n\nThat underperformance matters now because it helps explain why money is starting to flow out after a sweeping crypto downturn. IBIT just saw its sixth straight week of outflows — the longest losing streak since its inception — in a sign that the recent Bitcoin rebound has yet to restore investor conviction. In November, investors pulled more than $2.3 billion from the exchange-traded fund — the largest monthly redemption and only the second monthly withdrawal this year.\n\nOne reason: for many investors, the payoff hasn’t matched the pitch. The ETF wrapper may have solved the Bitcoin access problem — but not the timing problem.\n\n“The ETF has done its job — it has tracked Bitcoin almost perfectly and thus notched excellent total returns since inception,” Jeffrey Ptak, a managing director at Morningstar, wrote. “The problem is investors appear to have arrived late to the party.”\n\n![ ](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nBlackRock declined to comment.\n\nThe gap stems from the difference between what the fund earned and what investors actually experienced. Morningstar’s Ptak compared IBIT’s total return and dollar-weighted return. The result is a more realistic picture of how the average dollar fared.\n\nIn IBIT’s case, most inflows came after the ETF had already surged. By the time the fund’s asset base swelled, the pace of gains had slowed. That pattern — enthusiasm peaking after performance — is common in high-volatility investments, but the magnitude here was notable. Nearly 60% of IBIT’s total dollar gains came in its first 66 days, wrote Ptak, when few investors were actually in the fund.\n\nStory Continues\n\n“The large gap between the ETF’s dollar-weighted and total return underscores the importance of staying the course,” he said. “If current investors do so, their average dollar’s return should gradually converge toward the ETF’s total return. If not, it will likely continue to lag.”\n\nAll told, the average Bitcoin-ETF investor underperformed gold, the S&P 500 and even a plain-vanilla 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio, which returned more than 15% annualized over the stretch Ptak looked at.\n\nTo be sure, Ptak, in his conversations with BlackRock, highlighted factors that help explain the chasm, such as limited access to the Bitcoin funds early on, institutional derivatives-driven outflows — since big money funds like hedge funds use a popular trading strategy called the basis trade — and in-kind Bitcoin transfers, a recent development.\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts also argue that the token is a long-term hold, given its ability to rally back forcefully following major drawdowns.\n\nAnd regardless of one’s view, there’s no denying that demand has been strong. IBIT, for one, has received positive net flows on 80% of trading days since inception, according to Morningstar. Assets across US spot-Bitcoin ETFs total some $117 billion.\n\nIn the eyes of James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence, the analysis is fair. But dollar-weighted returns are just one window into a fund’s performance.\n\n“Dollar-weighted returns are more a critique of the investor than the fund adviser,” Seyffart said. “We know on average investor behavior is not great, particularly in high-momentum funds like this.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n- [Netflix Has a Huge Opportunity With the DC Studios Superheroes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/netflix-has-huge-opportunity-with-dc-studios-superheroes?utm_campaign=bw&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n- [YouTube Creators Find a New Consumer for AI Slop: Babies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/ai-slop-youtube-videos-for-kids-pretend-to-be-educational?utm_campaign=bw&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n- [How Trump Pushed US Park Rangers to the Breaking Point—and a Union Drive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-08/grand-canyon-glacier-joshua-tree-national-park-workers-rally-to-unionize?utm_campaign=bw&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n- [Will Chatbots Break Our Brains—And Our Hearts?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/podcast-will-chatbots-break-our-brains-and-our-hearts?utm_campaign=bw&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n- [How Impoverished People Selling Their Blood Fuels Drug Profits](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/how-impoverished-people-selling-their-blood-fuels-drug-profits?utm_campaign=bw&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\n[Terms](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Your Privacy Choices ![](https://s.yimg.com/dv/static/siteApp/img/privacy-choice-control.png)](https://guce.yahoo.com/state-controls?locale=en-US&state=VA)\n\n[More Info](https://finance.yahoo.com/more-info)\n\n* * *"

But the 2026 estimate was raised to $20.09 from $20, even with tariff risks baked into the new forecast.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Wall Street firm said consensus estimates do not fully appreciate management's ability to drive margin improvement. JPMorgan also said Caterpillar is a beneficiary of material-cost inflation because its customers in mining and oil and gas are looking to spend more on equipment.\n\nJPMorgan also views Caterpillar as \"the biggest winner of an extended U.S. construction cycle.\" It has named the heavy-equipment maker one of its top stock picks for 2026.\n\n* * *\n\n[**Here's How To Analyze Stocks Like Nvidia In Bull And Bear Markets**](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-analysis/)\n\n* * *\n\n## Non-Dow Jones Index Stocks To Watch\n\nTwo names to watch that are not part of the Dow Jones index are Genmab and KLA.\n\nShares of Genmab have rallied sharply in recent weeks, forming a cup with handle that offers a 32.48 buy point.

The company says it has eight medicines approved based on its science and about 20 products in development.\n\nMeanwhile, KLA is closing in on a cup-base buy point at 1,284.47, even as the stock slipped 0.2% Tuesday afternoon.\n\n**[KLA stock backstory](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/kla-stock-buy-signal-ai-chip-demand/):** A maker of wafer fabrication equipment, Milpitas, Calif.-based KLA specializes in process control and yield management systems.

(CAT): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\n\nWed, December 10, 2025 at 9:00 AM EST5 min read\n\n[CAT \\\\\n+3.53%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CAT/ \"CAT\")\n\n[^GSPC \\\\\n+0.67%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/ \"^GSPC\")\n\n**Caterpillar** (CAT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this construction equipment company have returned +4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, to which Caterpillar belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\n## Revisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Caterpillar is expected to post earnings of $4.52 per share, indicating a change of -12.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $18.4 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -16%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.86 indicates a change of +18.8% from what Caterpillar is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Caterpillar.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n## 12 Month EPS\n\n![12-month consensus EPS estimate for CAT](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for CAT\n\n## Projected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Caterpillar, the consensus sales estimate of $17.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.4%. The $66.11 billion and $71.55 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2% and +8.2%, respectively.\n\n## Last Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCaterpillar reported revenues of $17.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.5%. EPS of $4.95 for the same period compares with $5.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.32%. The EPS surprise was +9.51%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Caterpillar surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\n## Valuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCaterpillar is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Caterpillar. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Photograph: Brian Simuro/AP\n\nFirst, they put the baby otter, who they named Caterpillar, into a safe container where it wouldn’t overheat. Then, they recorded the sound of the pup’s frantic cries.\n\nThe plan was to boat around the area blasting the sound of the baby through a Bluetooth speaker to attempt to lure the mother towards the boat. They used a recording because they were worried that the pup would get tired and stop screaming, leaving them without any way to let the mom know that her pup had been found.\n\nIt wouldn’t be easy, but it wasn’t the first time that a sea otter pup had been reunited with its mother that way – a similar technique had been used in 2019.\n\nThe center presides over marine mammals that live across approximately 600 miles (about 966km) of California coastline, but the small crew was determined, searching for two hours and playing the screeching cry nonstop, Zink said.\n\n“Our intern had kept hitting play every once a minute,” she said. “I think we all went home and it was still playing over and over in our brains.”\n\nEventually, a female otter popped her head above water and followed the boat, which is behavior that Zink said wasn’t normal since otters typically only sleep, eat and groom their thick, furry coats – uninterested in humans on boats.\n\nBut this female otter was persistent, Zink said. Zink played the speaker on one side of the boat and then ran to play it on the other – and each time the otter followed her.\n\nEventually, once they felt certain that the otter was looking for her baby, the Zink lowered the pup into the water. [Video shows](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQuYzbkE5E0/) the mother swimming over to her baby, who floats helplessly on its back. Eventually, the mom grabs her baby in her arms and appears to smell him, running her small hands over its dense fur.\n\n“I definitely cried a bit,” Zink said.\n\nThe reunion has bigger significance to the region, where sea otters play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of marshy banks and preserving biodiversity.\n\nBy the 1920s, sea otters were nearly wiped out by centuries of industrial-scale hunting for their fur pelts, decimating a global population that once stretched from Alaska to California, as well as into Russia and Japan.\n\nHunting bans and habitat restoration efforts helped southern sea otters recover some of their former range, but Zink said that there are still only roughly 3,000 southern sea otters located in the California region.\n\n“It’s just a really special moment to be able to reunite this threatened species with its mother, because any and every individual in this population is so, so important to keeping it going and bringing it back from that threat status,” Zink said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n- [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california)\n- [West Coast](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/west-coast)\n- [Animals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals)\n- [Wildlife](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife)\n- [news](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news)\n\n[Share](mailto:?subject=Baby%20sea%20otter%20named%20Caterpillar%20rescued%20off%20central%20California%20coast&body=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/baby-sea-otter-rescued-off-california-coast?CMP=share_btn_url)\n\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2025%2Fnov%2F14%2Fbaby-sea-otter-rescued-off-california-coast&type=article&internalpagecode=us-news/2025/nov/14/baby-sea-otter-rescued-off-california-coast \"Reuse this content\")\n\n### Most viewed\n\n- [![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5afd4c70cd017e46730f568a3e300758d62fd6e/415_0_4137_3310/master/4137.jpg?width=75&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\\\\n\\\\\n**US forces seize oil tanker off Venezuela coast**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast)\n\n- [![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5091654600f765570f4aac44c2fefe1292a1e67e/0_581_4267_3413/master/4267.jpg?width=75&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Snakes alive!
