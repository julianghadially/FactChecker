      "instructions": "markdown\nYou are given:\n- An `original_statement` (a single textual statement).\n- A list of `claim_verdicts`. Each element is a dictionary with at least:\n  - `claim`: a textual claim (usually matching or decomposing the original_statement).\n  - `verdict`: one of `supported`, `not_supported`, or `refuted`.\n  - `evidence_summary`: a text summary of the evidence used to reach the verdict (you do not need to re‑evaluate this).\n\nYour task is to aggregate the individual claim verdicts into:\n1. An `overall_verdict` for the original_statement.\n2. A brief `reasoning` field explaining how you applied the logic.\n3. A numeric `confidence` between 0 and 1.\n\n## Core aggregation logic (must follow this priority order)\n\nYou must apply this exact priority logic:\n\n1. **If ANY claim has verdict `refuted` → overall_verdict = `CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS`**  \n   - This has the highest priority.\n   - It does not matter if other claims are supported or not_supported; a single refuted claim is enough.\n\n2. **Else, if NO claim is refuted but ANY claim has verdict `not_supported` → overall_verdict = `CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS`**  \n   - This is the next priority.\n   - It does not matter if other claims are supported; a single not_supported claim is enough, as long as there is no refuted claim.\n\n3. **Else, if ALL claims have verdict `supported` → overall_verdict = `SUPPORTED`**  \n   - This is the lowest priority and only applies when there are no refuted or not_supported claims.\n\nThese three outcomes are **mutually exclusive**; pick exactly one for each input.\n\n## Output format\n\nAlways produce exactly three top-level fields:\n\n- `reasoning`\n- `overall_verdict`\n- `confidence`\n\nExample structure:\n\n```text\n### reasoning\n<short explanation>\n\n### overall_verdict\nSUPPORTED | CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS | CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\n\n### confidence\n<value between 0 and 1>\n```\n\n### Reasoning\n\n- The reasoning should:\n  - Explicitly reference which verdict types are present in `claim_verdicts`.\n  - Explicitly state why that leads to the chosen `overall_verdict` under the priority rules above.\n- The reasoning should be **concise** (1–3 sentences). Do not restate large portions of the original statement or evidence summaries unless necessary.\n\nExample patterns:\n\n- If at least one `not_supported` and no `refuted` claims:\n  - “There is at least one claim evaluated as ‘not_supported’ and no refuted claims, so the overall verdict is `CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS`.”\n- If all `supported`:\n  - “All claims in the statement are evaluated as ‘supported’, and there are no refuted or unsupported claims, so the overall verdict is `SUPPORTED`.”\n- If any `refuted`:\n  - “At least one claim in the statement is evaluated as ‘refuted’, so by the priority rules the overall verdict is `CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS`.”\n\n### Confidence\n\n- Output a single numeric value between 0 and 1.\n- The confidence should reflect how straightforward the aggregation is, **not** uncertainty about the factual content (since individual verdicts are already given).\n  - If the aggregation is trivial and unambiguous (e.g., a single claim with a clear verdict), use a high value such as `1.0` or `0.95`.\n  - If there is some minor ambiguity (e.g., multiple mixed verdicts but still clearly resolved by the priority rules), you may use slightly lower values (e.g., `0.8–0.9`).\n- Use a **single decimal place or two at most** (e.g., `0.85`, `1.0`).\n\n## Additional requirements\n\n- **Do not override or reinterpret** the individual `claim_verdicts`. Treat them as correct and final.\n- **Do not introduce new verdict categories**; only use:\n  - `SUPPORTED`\n  - `CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS`\n  - `CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS`\n- Keep the language neutral and factual; do not speculate beyond the provided verdicts.\n- Do not change, correct, or elaborate on the original_statement or the claims themselves; your sole job is aggregation according to the priority rules above.",
