    "signature": {
      "instructions": "You are given:\n- An `original_statement` (a natural language statement, possibly containing one or more factual claims).\n- A list of `claim_verdicts`, where each element is a dictionary with the keys:\n  - `claim`: a textual claim (usually derived from the original_statement).\n  - `verdict`: one of {'supported', 'not_supported', 'refuted'}.\n  - `evidence_summary`: a text summary of evidence and/or search results used to evaluate that claim (may be empty or contain irrelevant details).\n\nYour task is to aggregate the individual claim verdicts into:\n1. A short natural language explanation of how you applied the aggregation rule (`reasoning`).\n2. A single label for the entire original_statement (`overall_verdict`).\n3. A confidence score between 0 and 1 (`confidence`).\n\n### Input format\n\nYou will be given something equivalent to:\n\n- `original_statement`: string\n\n- `claim_verdicts`: list[dict], for example:\n  [\n    {\n      \"claim\": \"<string>\",\n      \"verdict\": \"supported\" | \"not_supported\" | \"refuted\",\n      \"evidence_summary\": \"<string, may be empty>\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n\nDo **not** re-evaluate the factual claims yourself. Treat each `verdict` value in `claim_verdicts` as already correct, regardless of the evidence text or your external knowledge. For example:\n- If `verdict` is \"supported\" but the evidence_summary looks weak or empty, you must still treat it as supported.\n- If `verdict` is \"not_supported\" because no evidence was found, you must still treat it as not_supported.\n- If `verdict` is \"refuted\", treat it as refuted even if you personally believe the claim might be true.\n\nThe aggregation is purely mechanical over the provided `verdict` fields.\n\n### Aggregation logic (priority order)\n\nApply this logic to produce `overall_verdict`:\n\n1. If **any** claim in `claim_verdicts` has `verdict == \"refuted\"`, then:\n   - `overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\"`\n   - This is the **highest priority** and overrides all other conditions.\n\n2. Else, if **any** claim has `verdict == \"not_supported\"`, then:\n   - `overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\"`\n\n3. Else, if **all** claims have `verdict == \"supported\"`, then:\n   - `overall_verdict = \"SUPPORTED\"`\n\nYou will **always** produce one of these three labels:\n- `CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS`\n- `CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS`\n- `SUPPORTED`\n\nDo **not** invent or use any other overall labels (such as UNKNOWN, NEI, etc.).\n\n### Reasoning guidelines\n\n- In `reasoning`, explicitly reference how the individual claim verdicts trigger the aggregation rules above.\n- You **may** restate the original claim(s) briefly to clarify, but keep it concise.\n- Focus on the status of the claims, not on re-arguing the evidence. For example:\n  - If there is a single claim with verdict \"supported\": explain that since all claims are supported, the overall verdict is \"SUPPORTED\".\n  - If there is at least one \"not_supported\" and no \"refuted\": explain that the presence of at least one unsupported claim leads to \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\".\n  - If there is at least one \"refuted\": explain that any refuted claim leads to \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\", regardless of other supported claims.\n\nDo **not**:\n- Override or reinterpret the given per-claim verdicts based on your own world knowledge or the evidence_summary.\n- Introduce new claims.\n- Change the priority order of the rules.\n\n### Confidence\n\n- Output `confidence` as a floating-point number between 0 and 1.\n- Since the task is a straightforward rule-based aggregation, you can generally use a high confidence such as:\n  - 1.0 if the aggregation is unambiguous (typical when all verdicts are clearly one category or the priority rule is straightforward to apply).\n  - Slightly less than 1.0 only if the input is malformed or ambiguous (e.g., empty list of claim_verdicts, missing fields, or unexpected verdict labels). In such edge cases, explain this in the reasoning.\n\n### Output format\n\nReturn a JSON-like structure with exactly these top-level keys:\n\n- `reasoning`: a short paragraph (2–5 sentences) explaining how you applied the aggregation rules to the given claim_verdicts.\n- `overall_verdict`: one of \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\", \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\", or \"SUPPORTED\".\n- `confidence`: a numeric value between 0 and 1.\n\nExample template:\n\nreasoning\n<your explanation here>\n\noverall_verdict\n<one of the three allowed labels>\n\nconfidence\n<your numeric confidence>",
