      "instructions": "You are given one or more natural-language statements under a key called `statement`.\n\nYour task is to identify and extract the *claims* made in the input. A “claim” is any proposition that asserts something that can in principle be true or false (i.e., it is not a question, command, exclamation, or purely expressive utterance).\n\nFollow these rules:\n\n1. **Output structure**\n   - Always produce exactly two top-level keys:\n     - `reasoning`: A brief explanation (1–3 sentences) of how you identified the claim(s).\n     - `claims`: A JSON array of strings, where each string is one extracted claim.\n   - Example structure:\n     - `reasoning`: \"…\"\n     - `claims`: [\"…\", \"…\"]\n\n2. **What to treat as a claim**\n   - A sentence or clause that:\n     - Asserts a fact about the world (past, present, or future), **or**\n     - Makes a comparative or quantitative assertion, **or**\n     - Asserts a property, identity, category membership, or relationship of an entity.\n   - The content can be about:\n     - Identity or occupation:  \n       - Example: “Robert Koch was a German physician and microbiologist” →  \n         `[\"Robert Koch was a German physician\", \"Robert Koch was a microbiologist\"]`\n     - Location:  \n       - Example: “Methuselah is located in the White Mountains of California” →  \n         `[\"Methuselah is located in the White Mountains of California\"]`\n     - Comparative statements:  \n       - Example: “Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans” →  \n         `[\"Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans\"]`\n\n3. **Granularity of claims**\n   - If a single statement clearly contains **multiple distinct factual assertions**, split them into separate claims.\n   - Distinctness criteria (use all that apply):\n     - Different **roles or categories** assigned to the same subject.  \n       - Example: “Robert Koch was a German physician and microbiologist”  \n         - Two roles → two claims:\n           - \"Robert Koch was a German physician\"\n           - \"Robert Koch was a microbiologist\"\n     - Clearly separable properties that could be independently true or false without changing the rest of the statement.\n   - If the statement expresses **one integrated idea** (e.g., a single comparison or a single location), keep it as **one** claim, even if it mentions multiple entities.\n     - Example: “Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans” →  \n       One comparative assertion → one claim:\n       - \"Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans\"\n     - Example: “Methuselah is located in the White Mountains of California” →  \n       One location assertion → one claim.\n\n4. **How to split or not split**\n   - **Split** when:\n     - There is a natural “and” joining two different roles, categories, or properties that could logically stand as separate sentences without losing meaning:\n       - “X is a writer and a politician” →  \n         - “X is a writer”  \n         - “X is a politician”\n   - **Do not split** when:\n     - The structure is inherently comparative:  \n       - “X is taller than Y” → keep as one claim.\n     - The structure provides additional detail that does not naturally stand alone as a separate fact:\n       - “X lives in the capital city of Y” → one claim.\n       - “X is the highest mountain in Y” → one claim.\n\n5. **What to ignore**\n   - Do **not** output:\n     - Questions (e.g., “Do Canadians work fewer hours than Mexicans?”).\n     - Commands or instructions.\n     - Purely emotional or expressive statements that do not assert a testable proposition.\n\n6. **Rephrasing**\n   - Maintain the original meaning as closely as possible.\n   - It is acceptable to slightly rephrase for clarity, but do not add information or change the claim type (e.g., do not turn an occupation into an achievement, or a comparison into two unrelated facts).\n\n7. **No extra content**\n   - Do not add commentary, metadata, or any keys other than `reasoning` and `claims`.\n   - The `claims` list may be empty if no claims are present, but the key must still exist.",
