      "instructions": "You are given one or more natural-language statements. Your task is to extract the claims expressed in those statements.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n\n1. Core task\n   - Return a list of concise, self-contained claims derived from the input statement(s).\n   - A “claim” is a proposition that could in principle be true or false (i.e., it asserts something about the world, a person, an event, a property, a causal relation, etc.).\n\n2. Granularity\n   - Split clearly separable, *conjunctive* information into distinct claims.\n     - Example: “Robert Koch was a German physician and microbiologist”\n       - Output:\n         - “Robert Koch was a German physician”\n         - “Robert Koch was a microbiologist”\n   - Do NOT split a single, unified proposition into smaller paraphrases that repeat the same content.\n     - Example: “Not all Mexicans are members of the same church”\n       - Output:\n         - “Not all Mexicans are members of the same church”\n       - Do NOT add variants like:\n         - “Mexicans do not all belong to a single church”\n   - Be careful not to introduce new claims that are only loosely implied or that generalize beyond the original.\n     - Example: “Veins appear blue because of the way light passes through human skin”\n       - This expresses a single causal explanation. The correct extraction is:\n         - “Veins appear blue because of the way light passes through human skin”\n       - Do NOT split into:\n         - “Veins appear blue”\n         - “The way light passes through human skin affects the color of veins”\n       - because this changes the structure and strength of the original claim.\n\n3. Faithfulness to the original\n   - Preserve the original meaning, scope, and modality as closely as possible.\n   - Do not:\n     - Add new information.\n     - Generalize, weaken, or strengthen the claim.\n     - Turn one specific causal claim into a set of more general claims.\n   - Negations and quantifiers must be preserved exactly:\n     - “Not all Mexicans…” is different from “No Mexicans…” or “Some Mexicans…”.\n\n4. When to combine vs. separate\n   - Separate into multiple claims when:\n     - The statement is a clear conjunction of distinct attributes/entities that can stand alone as claims without changing meaning.\n       - “X is A and B” → “X is A”; “X is B”.\n   - Keep as a single claim when:\n     - The statement expresses a specific causal, conditional, or explanatory relationship that would be distorted if broken apart.\n       - “X happens because Y” stays as one claim.\n\n5. Output format\n   - Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or commentary in the final answer.\n   - Output only a JSON-like list under the key `claims`, for example:\n     - `[\"claim 1\", \"claim 2\", ...]`\n   - Do not include the word “reasoning” or any reasoning field in your response.\n\nIn summary: extract a minimal set of self-contained, truth-apt claims that exactly reflect the original statement(s), splitting only clearly conjunctive information, and avoid paraphrasing or expanding into additional, more general claims.",
