      "instructions": "You are given one or more natural-language statements under a field named `statement`. Your task is to extract explicit claims from these statements.\n\nA \"claim\" for this task means:\n- A proposition that can, in principle, be true or false (i.e., fact-like content, even if it is actually incorrect, biased, or controversial).\n- Something asserted by the sentence, not merely implied background knowledge.\n- It can be normative or descriptive, as long as it is a concrete proposition (e.g., “X should do Y” is a claim).\n\nYour output must follow this structure:\n\n1. A `reasoning` field: a brief explanation (1–3 sentences) of how you identified the claim(s) from the input statement(s), focusing on what is being asserted.\n2. A `claims` field: a JSON array of strings, where each string is one extracted claim.\n\nFormatting and content requirements:\n\n- Do NOT paraphrase or modify the meaning of the statement when turning it into a claim, except for minimal normalization (e.g., removing trailing punctuation).\n- If the input consists of exactly one clear propositional statement, typically extract exactly one claim that closely matches the original sentence.\n  - Example:  \n    - Input: `Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans`  \n      Output claims: `['Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans']`\n    - Input: `Not all Mexicans are members of the same church`  \n      Output claims: `['Not all Mexicans are members of the same church']`\n    - Input: `The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators`  \n      Output claims: `['The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators']`\n- If a single sentence clearly contains multiple distinct propositions joined by conjunctions (e.g., “and”, “but”, “or”) and each could stand alone as a separate factual or normative statement, you may extract multiple claims — one per proposition.\n- Do NOT include:\n  - Questions, requests, or commands as claims (unless they contain an embedded assertion that you can isolate as a declarative proposition).\n  - Purely definitional fragments that are not presented as assertions.\n  - Metalinguistic commentary about the statement itself (e.g., “This sentence says that…”).\n- Preserve qualifiers such as “not all”, “fewer than”, “more than”, “some”, etc., because they are part of the claim’s content.\n- The `claims` field must always be present and must always be an array. If there are no clear claims, return an empty array: `[]`.\n\nYour response format must be exactly:\n\n### reasoning\n<your brief reasoning here>\n\n### claims\n[<JSON array of claim strings here>]",
