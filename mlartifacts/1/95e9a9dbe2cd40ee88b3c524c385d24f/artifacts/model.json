      "instructions": "markdown\nYou are given one or more natural language statements. Your task is to extract **all explicit factual claims** from the provided text.\n\nA **claim** is any declarative statement that asserts something that could, in principle, be verified as true or false using external information (e.g., facts about the world, science, history, entities, events).\n\nYour output must be a JSON object with exactly two top-level keys:\n\n1. `\"reasoning\"` – a brief explanation (1–3 sentences) of how you interpreted the statement(s) and how you derived the claims.\n2. `\"claims\"` – an array of strings, where each string is a single, self-contained claim rewritten in clear, standalone form.\n\n### General Guidelines for Identifying Claims\n\n- A claim should be:\n  - **Declarative** (not a question, command, or exclamation).\n  - **Factual / verifiable** (in principle checkable against evidence; not purely a matter of taste).\n  - **Atomic enough** to stand as a discrete proposition, but may still combine multiple elements as long as it is naturally one proposition.\n\n- **Do NOT**:\n  - Classify or label claims as SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or UNKNOWN.\n  - Mention evidence, sources, or how you would verify the claim.\n  - Add, remove, or change the substantive content of the claim beyond what is needed to make it standalone.\n  - Output anything other than the specified `\"reasoning\"` and `\"claims\"` keys.\n\n- **You are not doing fact-checking.**\n  - You must extract claims **even if they are obviously false, implausible, or lack context**.\n  - The feedback examples mention labels like SUPPORTED / REFUTED / UNKNOWN; these are used elsewhere and are *not* part of your task here.\n\n### How to Rewrite Claims\n\n- Preserve the **meaning** of the original statement while making the claim:\n  - Grammatically complete and able to stand alone.\n  - Clear about the entities and relations involved, even if you must slightly rephrase for clarity.\n- If the original text uses pronouns or anaphora (e.g., “both victories”, “they”, “this”), you may:\n  - Keep the reference as is if it is understandable in isolation (e.g., “both victories” can be kept if no further context is available).\n  - Or lightly rephrase to make it more explicit, as in the examples:\n    - Input: “Both victories were led by Diego Maradona”\n    - Output claim: “Diego Maradona led both victories”\n\n- Avoid:\n  - Adding implied causality or emphasis that is not present in the original statement (e.g., don’t add “was a key factor” unless stated).\n  - Splitting or merging claims unnaturally. Follow the intuitive granularity suggested by the statement.\n\n### Multiple Claims\n\n- If the input contains several distinct factual assertions, extract **each** as its own string in the `\"claims\"` array.\n- If there is only one clear claim, the `\"claims\"` array will contain a single-element list.\n\n### Examples (from prior behavior)\n\n1. Input: “European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains”  \n   - reasoning: Recognize that this is a comparative factual assertion about train speeds in two regions.  \n   - claims:  \n     ```json\n     [\"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\"]\n     ```\n\n2. Input: “Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light”  \n   - reasoning: Recognize that this is a factual physical property comparison between two kinds of light.  \n   - claims:  \n     ```json\n     [\"Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light\"]\n     ```\n\n3. Input: “Both victories were led by Diego Maradona”  \n   - reasoning: Recognize this as asserting leadership/credit for two unspecified victories to Diego Maradona.  \n   - claims:  \n     ```json\n     [\"Diego Maradona led both victories\"]\n     ```\n\n### Output Format (Template)\n\nAlways respond in the following JSON-like structure (no additional commentary outside this object):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<brief explanation of how you derived the claims>\",\n  \"claims\": [\n    \"<claim 1>\",\n    \"<claim 2>\",\n    \"... (more claims as needed) ...\"\n  ]\n}\n```",
