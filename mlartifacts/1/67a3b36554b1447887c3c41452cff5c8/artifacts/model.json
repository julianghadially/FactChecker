      "instructions": "You are given one or more natural-language statements under the key `statement`.\n\nYour task is to extract the *claims* expressed in the statement(s).\n\nA **claim** is any proposition that asserts something that could, in principle, be true or false (i.e., it is fact-like and verifiable or falsifiable). It does not matter whether the claim is actually true; what matters is that it presents itself as an assertion about the world.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Output format**\n   - Respond in JSON with two top-level keys:\n     - `\"reasoning\"`: a brief explanation (1–3 sentences) of how you interpreted the statement and identified the claim(s).\n     - `\"claims\"`: a list (array) of strings, each string being one extracted claim.\n   - Example template:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"reasoning\": \"…\",\n       \"claims\": [\n         \"…\",\n         \"…\"\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **What to include as claims**\n   - Include each **distinct propositional assertion** that can be evaluated as true or false.\n   - The claim should usually be restated as a **standalone sentence** closely matching the original wording.\n   - Claims can be about:\n     - Facts about the world (e.g., “European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains”).\n     - Generalizations (e.g., “Not all Mexicans are members of the same church”).\n     - Specific events or states of affairs (e.g., “Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015”).\n\n3. **What not to do**\n   - Do **not** rephrase or split simple statements unnecessarily if they already contain a single clear claim.\n     - E.g., for: `European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains`\n       - Correct: `[\"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\"]`\n       - Avoid: `[\"European trains tend to run at higher speeds\", \"American trains run at lower speeds than European trains\"]`\n   - Do **not** add interpretation, speculation, or implied extra claims beyond what is explicitly asserted.\n   - Do **not** output opinions about the truth of the claims; just extract them.\n\n4. **Single vs. multiple claims**\n   - If the input statement clearly expresses **one** main assertion, output exactly one item in the `claims` list, mirroring the wording as closely as possible.\n     - E.g., `Not all Mexicans are members of the same church`\n       - → `[\"Not all Mexicans are members of the same church\"]`\n   - If there are **multiple, clearly separate assertions** joined by connectors like “and”, “but”, etc., you may split them into multiple claims **only if** they each stand alone as distinct propositions and are not just comparative parts of one overall statement.\n   - For **comparative or relational statements** (e.g., “X is higher than Y”), treat the whole comparison as **one** claim, not two separate ones.\n\n5. **Handling uncertainty and modality**\n   - Statements with hedging or modality (e.g., “tend to”, “might”, “could”, “usually”) still count as claims if they assert a probabilistic or typical state of affairs.\n   - Preserve the modal/hedging language in the extracted claim (e.g., keep “tend to”, “not all”, “often”).\n\n6. **Faithfulness to the original**\n   - Preserve the core content and qualifiers of the original statement (e.g., time, place, quantifiers).\n   - You may perform light grammatical adjustments to make the claim a complete, well-formed sentence, but do not change its meaning.\n\nApply these rules to every input and always produce both `\"reasoning\"` and `\"claims\"` as specified.",
