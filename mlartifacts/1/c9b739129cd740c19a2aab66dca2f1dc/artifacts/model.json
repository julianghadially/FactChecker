      "instructions": "You are given:\n- An `original_statement`: a natural-language statement that may contain one or more factual claims.\n- A list of `claim_verdicts`: each item is a dictionary with:\n  - `claim`: a (sub)claim extracted from the original statement\n  - `verdict`: one of {\"supported\", \"not_supported\", \"refuted\"}\n  - `evidence_summary`: a (possibly empty) text summary of the evidence used to judge that claim\n\nYour task is to aggregate the individual claim verdicts into a single overall verdict for the original statement, and to explain your reasoning briefly.\n\n## Core task\n\n1. Read all entries in `claim_verdicts`.\n2. Apply this **priority logic** to determine the `overall_verdict`:\n\n   1. If **any** claim has `verdict: \"refuted\"`  \n      → `overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\"` (highest priority).\n\n   2. Else, if **any** claim has `verdict: \"not_supported\"`  \n      → `overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\"`.\n\n   3. Else, if **all** claims have `verdict: \"supported\"`  \n      → `overall_verdict = \"SUPPORTED\"`.\n\n   There are no other allowed values for `overall_verdict`.\n\n3. Produce:\n   - `reasoning`: a concise explanation of how you applied the above rules to the given `claim_verdicts`.\n   - `overall_verdict`: exactly one of:\n     - `CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS`\n     - `CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS`\n     - `SUPPORTED`\n   - `confidence`: a numeric value in [0, 1], representing how confident you are that you applied the aggregation logic correctly.\n     - Use high confidence (e.g., 0.9–1.0) when the mapping from claim verdicts to overall verdict is straightforward.\n     - Only lower the confidence if there is genuine ambiguity about how to interpret the given claim verdicts, **not** based on the underlying world knowledge.\n\n## Interpretation details\n\n- Treat `claim_verdicts` as already-fact-checked units. Do **not** redo fact-checking or search for new evidence; your job is purely to aggregate.\n- The semantics of individual verdicts:\n  - `\"supported\"`: Evidence backs the claim.\n  - `\"not_supported\"`: There is insufficient or inconclusive evidence to confirm the claim; it is not necessarily false, just not backed by the available evidence.\n  - `\"refuted\"`: Evidence contradicts the claim.\n- The original statement may be a single claim or a conjunction of multiple claims. Your aggregation is always over the `claim_verdicts` list, not by re-parsing `original_statement`.\n\n## Style and formatting\n\n- Output in exactly this key structure (order can be as below, but key names must match):\n\n  - `reasoning`\n  - `overall_verdict`\n  - `confidence`\n\n- `reasoning`:\n  - Be concise and task-focused.\n  - Explicitly mention:\n    - How many claims are supported / not_supported / refuted.\n    - Which rule from the priority logic determined the outcome.\n  - Do not repeat the full evidence summaries; you may refer to them conceptually (e.g., “based on the evidence summaries, both claims are supported”).\n\n- `overall_verdict`:\n  - Must be one of the three exact strings above.\n  - Make sure it matches the priority logic even if it conflicts with any intuitive impression of the original statement.\n\n- `confidence`:\n  - Use a single floating-point number (e.g., `1.0`, `0.8`).\n  - For clean, unambiguous inputs like the provided examples, `1.0` is appropriate.\n\n## Examples of correct aggregation\n\n- If you receive:\n  - One claim with `verdict: \"supported\"`  \n    → `overall_verdict = \"SUPPORTED\"`.\n- If you receive:\n  - One or more claims with `verdict: \"not_supported\"` and none with `\"refuted\"`  \n    → `overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\"`.\n- If you receive:\n  - At least one claim with `verdict: \"refuted\"` (regardless of any supported or not_supported claims)  \n    → `overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\"`.\n\nFollow this aggregation logic strictly and deterministically.",
