      "instructions": "You are given one or more natural-language statements under the key `statement`.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Identify and extract all explicit factual claims made in the statement(s).\n2. Return them as a list of strings under the key `claims`.\n3. Optionally, provide a brief natural-language explanation of how you identified the claims under the key `reasoning`.\n\nDETAILED REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. What counts as a “claim”:\n   - A claim is any declarative statement that asserts something that can, in principle, be true or false (i.e., is fact-like or verifiable/contestable).\n   - Claims may be about:\n     - Concrete facts (e.g., “Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015.”)\n     - Generalizations about groups (e.g., “European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains.”)\n     - Statements about diversity or non-uniformity (e.g., “Not all Mexicans are members of the same church.”)\n   - You do NOT need to determine whether the claim is actually true. Do not perform fact-checking. Simply extract what is being claimed.\n\n2. What is NOT required:\n   - Do not judge or label claims as SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or UNKNOWN.\n   - Do not speculate on evidence or sources.\n   - Do not rewrite or rephrase the claims unnecessarily; keep them as close as possible to the original wording, changing only what is needed to make them standalone, grammatical claims.\n\n3. Handling the input:\n   - The input will be in this form:\n     - A top-level key `statement` whose value is a sentence or paragraph (possibly multiple sentences).\n   - Consider all sentences in `statement`; each may contain zero, one, or multiple claims.\n\n4. Extracting claims:\n   - For each distinct factual assertion in the text, output one string in the `claims` list.\n   - If the entire statement is a single, simple factual claim, return it as a single-element list.\n   - If multiple claims are present, separate them into multiple items.\n   - If there is no factual claim (e.g., purely questions, commands, or exclamations that do not assert facts), return an empty list: `[]`.\n\n5. Granularity guidelines:\n   - If a sentence asserts multiple independent facts joined by “and”, “but”, etc., split them into separate claims where they can clearly stand alone.\n     - Example: “European trains are faster than American trains and more punctual.”  \n       → `[\"European trains are faster than American trains\", \"European trains are more punctual than American trains\"]`\n   - If the sentence contains qualifiers or hedges (e.g., “tend to”, “usually”, “often”), keep them in the claim; they are part of what is being asserted.\n     - Example: “European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains.”  \n       → `[\"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\"]`\n   - For statements of the form “Not all X are Y”, keep the logical structure intact.\n     - Example: “Not all Mexicans are members of the same church.”  \n       → `[\"Not all Mexicans are members of the same church\"]`\n\n6. Reasoning field:\n   - The `reasoning` text should briefly describe:\n     - What the statement is generally asserting.\n     - How you identified which part(s) of the text are claims.\n   - Keep `reasoning` concise and high-level; a few sentences are sufficient.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Always produce a JSON-like structure with the two keys `reasoning` and `claims`.\n   - Example output format:\n\n   ### reasoning\n   <your explanation here>\n\n   ### claims\n   ['first claim here', 'second claim here', ...]\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nInput:\n### statement\nEuropean trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\n\nExpected style of output:\n### reasoning\nThe statement compares the speed of trains in Europe and America, asserting that European trains generally operate at faster speeds than American trains. This is a single factual claim about relative train speeds.\n\n### claims\n['European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains']\n\n---\n\nInput:\n### statement\nNot all Mexicans are members of the same church\n\nExpected style of output:\n### reasoning\nThe statement makes a factual assertion about religious diversity among Mexicans, claiming that their church membership is not uniform.\n\n### claims\n['Not all Mexicans are members of the same church']\n\n---\n\nInput:\n### statement\nJack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015\n\nExpected style of output:\n### reasoning\nThe statement asserts a specific fact about Jack Dorsey's role at Twitter, namely that he resumed the CEO position in a particular year.\n\n### claims\n['Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015']",
