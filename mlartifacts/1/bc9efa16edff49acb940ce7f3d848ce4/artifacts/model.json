A list of `claim_verdicts`: each element is a dictionary with at least:\n   - \"claim\": a text span representing an individual claim extracted from the original_statement (or closely paraphrasing part/all of it).\n   - \"verdict\": one of:\n       • \"supported\"      – evidence clearly supports this claim  \n       • \"refuted\"        – evidence clearly contradicts this claim  \n       • \"not_supported\"  – there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute this claim\n   - \"evidence_summary\": a (possibly empty) text field briefly describing the evidence basis for the verdict.\n\nYour task is to aggregate the individual claim verdicts into a single, overall verdict for the entire `original_statement`. You must strictly apply the following priority logic:\n\n1. If ANY claim in `claim_verdicts` has verdict == \"refuted\"\n   → overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\"\n\n2. ELSE IF NO claims are refuted AND AT LEAST ONE claim has verdict == \"not_supported\"\n   → overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\"\n\n3. ELSE IF ALL claims have verdict == \"supported\"\n   → overall_verdict = \"SUPPORTED\"\n\nAssume:\n- The list of claim_verdicts is complete and authoritative for the purposes of the aggregation; do not introduce new claims or override individual claim verdicts.\n- \"not_supported\" means the evidence is inconclusive or missing, not that the claim is known to be false.\n- A single claim can determine the overall verdict according to the priority order above (e.g., one refuted claim is enough to produce \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS,\" even if other claims are supported).\n\nYou must produce three fields:\n\n1. `reasoning`  \n   - Briefly explain how you applied the above priority logic to the given list of claim verdicts.\n   - Reference only the verdict labels of the claims (supported / refuted / not_supported) and their count or presence; you do not need to restate full evidence.\n   - Do NOT re-evaluate the factual correctness of the claims; only explain the aggregation.\n\n2. `overall_verdict`  \n   - One of exactly: \"SUPPORTED\", \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\", or \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\".\n   - Determined solely by the three-step priority logic above.\n\n3. `confidence`  \n   - A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing how confident you are in your aggregation of the claim verdicts (not in the truth of the statement itself).\n   - In general, if you have correctly applied the deterministic logic and the input format is clear, this should be high (e.g., 0.9–1.0).\n\nOutput format (JSON-like keys, but plain text is fine as long as keys are present):\n\nreasoning\n<your explanation>\n\noverall_verdict\n<one of SUPPORTED / CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS / CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS>\n\nconfidence\n<value between 0 and 1>\n\nExamples of correct aggregation behavior:\n\n- If the only claim has verdict \"supported\" → overall_verdict = \"SUPPORTED\".\n- If the only claim has verdict \"not_supported\" → overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\".\n- If there are multiple claims and at least one is \"refuted\", regardless of the others → overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS\".\n- If there are multiple claims, none \"refuted\", and at least one \"not_supported\" → overall_verdict = \"CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS\".\n- Only when every single claim is \"supported\" and none is \"refuted\" or \"not_supported\" → overall_verdict = \"SUPPORTED\".",
