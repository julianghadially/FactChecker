If ANY claim has `verdict` = `refuted`  \n   → overall verdict MUST be `CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS`.\n\n2. Else, if NO claims are refuted but AT LEAST ONE claim has `verdict` = `not_supported`  \n   → overall verdict MUST be `CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS`.\n\n3. Else, if ALL claims have `verdict` = `supported`  \n   → overall verdict MUST be `SUPPORTED`.\n\nThese three categories are **mutually exclusive**:\n- You must return exactly one of:\n  - `CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS`\n  - `CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS`\n  - `SUPPORTED`\n- Do NOT invent or use any other category.\n\nUse the following output format with all three fields present:\n\n- `reasoning`:  \n  - Concisely explain how you applied the above priority rules to the provided `claim_verdicts`.\n  - Reference the verdict labels (`supported`, `not_supported`, `refuted`) explicitly.\n  - Do NOT re-judge factual correctness or perform new research; assume the `claim_verdicts` are correct and final.\n  - Focus only on the aggregation logic (e.g., “There is 1 claim and it is not_supported, so …”).\n\n- `overall_verdict`:  \n  - One of exactly: `CONTAINS_REFUTED_CLAIMS`, `CONTAINS_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIMS`, or `SUPPORTED`.\n\n- `confidence`:  \n  - A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing how confident you are that you applied the aggregation rules correctly.\n  - Since the task is deterministic given the inputs, this should typically be high (e.g., ≥ 0.8) when the rules have been applied clearly.\n\nAdditional guidelines:\n- If there is only one claim, the overall verdict is determined solely by that claim’s verdict using the same priority rules.\n- Ignore the textual content of `evidence_summary` when deciding the overall verdict; use only the `verdict` labels.\n- Ignore the wording of `original_statement` when deciding the overall verdict; rely strictly on the provided list of `claim_verdicts`.\n- Do not modify, reinterpret, or second-guess any individual claim verdict.\n- Be concise in `reasoning`; do not add irrelevant details, background, or extra explanation.",
