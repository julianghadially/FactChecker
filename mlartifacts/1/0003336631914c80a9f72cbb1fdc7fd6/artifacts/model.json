      "instructions": "You are given one or more short natural-language statements under the key `statement`.\n\nYour task is to extract the explicit claim(s) asserted in the text and return them as a list of short, self-contained sentences.\n\nFollow these rules:\n\n1. Core goal\n   - Identify what is being *directly claimed* as true in the statement.\n   - Represent each distinct claim as a separate, simple sentence.\n   - Do not evaluate whether the claims are true or false; just extract them.\n\n2. Granularity\n   - Split conjunctions that contain multiple claims into separate items **only when**:\n     - Each part stands on its own as a factual assertion that could in principle be true or false independently.\n   - Do **not** over-split by introducing new, more general or rephrased claims that are not explicitly stated.\n   - Aim to stay close to the wording and specificity of the input.\n\n3. No extra inference\n   - Do **not** add implied or generalized claims that are not explicitly asserted.\n   - Do **not** rewrite the claim into a more abstract scientific or explanatory statement.\n   - Keep the claim as close as possible to the original wording, only adjusting grammar so that each item is a standalone sentence.\n\n   Examples:\n   - Input: `Robert Koch was a German physician and microbiologist`\n     - Output: `['Robert Koch was a German physician', 'Robert Koch was a microbiologist']`\n       - Justification: Two explicit, coordinate predicates about the same subject.\n   - Input: `Veins appear blue because of the way light passes through human skin`\n     - Output: `['Veins appear blue because of the way light passes through human skin']`\n       - Do **not** split into:\n         - `'Veins appear blue'`\n         - `'The way light passes through human skin affects the color of veins'`\n       - The statement is a single causal/explanatory claim; splitting it introduces a more general, inferred claim not literally asserted.\n   - Input: `Methuselah is located in the White Mountains of California`\n     - Output: `['Methuselah is located in the White Mountains of California']`\n       - Do not introduce alternate phrasings or location generalizations.\n\n4. Allowed transformations\n   - You may:\n     - Drop clearly redundant words if needed for grammaticality.\n     - Separate coordinated predicates or objects into distinct claims when each is explicitly and independently asserted (as in the Robert Koch example).\n   - You must **not**:\n     - Introduce new causal, explanatory, or generalized formulations that are not present verbatim or near-verbatim in the statement.\n\n5. Output format\n   - Do **not** include any reasoning or explanation in your response.\n   - Output **only** a JSON-style Python list of strings under the key `claims`.\n   - Example:\n     - `{\"claims\": [\"Claim sentence 1\", \"Claim sentence 2\"]}`\n\nIf there are no clear factual claims in the input, return an empty list: `{\"claims\": []}`.",
