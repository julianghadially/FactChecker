      "instructions": "You are given one or more natural-language statements under the key `statement`.\n\nYour task is to extract the **claims** expressed in the statement(s).\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n\n1. **What is a “claim”?**\n   - A claim is a proposition that asserts something that could, in principle, be true or false.\n   - It typically:\n     - Attributes a property, role, or characteristic to an entity, OR\n     - States that some event or relation holds (or held or will hold) between entities.\n\n2. **Granularity of claims**\n   - Prefer to output **the minimal set of claims that captures the full meaning of the statement without unnecessary splitting**.\n   - Do **not** break a single coherent claim into multiple smaller claims unless the original statement clearly expresses them as distinct, independent assertions.\n   - Example:\n     - Input: `Robert Koch was a German physician and microbiologist`\n       - Output: `['Robert Koch was a German physician', 'Robert Koch was a microbiologist']`\n       - Rationale: The conjunction explicitly ascribes two separate occupations.\n     - Input: `The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators`\n       - Output: `['The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators']`\n       - Rationale: This is one unified claim. Do not split it into “The New Populism existed” and “The New Populism had political positions”.\n\n3. **Avoid over-inferencing or rephrasing**\n   - Only extract claims that are **directly stated or clearly implied by the wording**, not claims that require additional unstated assumptions.\n   - Do not invent or add new information.\n   - Avoid “generalized” or “re-expressed” claims that go beyond the exact content.\n   - Example:\n     - Input: `Veins appear blue because of the way light passes through human skin`\n       - Correct-style output: `['Veins appear blue because of the way light passes through human skin']`\n       - Incorrect: `['Veins appear blue', 'The way light passes through human skin affects the color of veins']`\n         - This splits the causal explanation into two claims and introduces a more general second claim than the original.\n\n4. **Conjunctions and lists**\n   - If a statement uses “and”, “or”, commas, or other coordinators to list **multiple clearly separable predicates about the same subject**, you may split them into separate claims, as in the Robert Koch example.\n   - If the sentence expresses a **single causal, explanatory, temporal, or conditional structure**, keep it as **one claim**.\n     - E.g., “X happens because Y” → single claim.\n     - “X did A and B” where A and B are distinct actions or roles → often two claims.\n   - When unsure, err on the side of **fewer, more comprehensive claims** that most directly mirror the original sentence structure.\n\n5. **Faithfulness to original wording**\n   - You may lightly rephrase for grammatical completeness, but keep:\n     - The same subject(s)\n     - The same core predicate(s)\n     - The same relations (e.g., cause, advocacy, attribution)\n   - Do not generalize beyond what is stated.\n\n6. **Output format**\n   - Do **not** output any reasoning, explanations, or additional fields.\n   - Return a JSON-style list of strings under the key `claims`.\n   - Example format:\n     - `['Claim 1 text', 'Claim 2 text']`\n\nApply these rules consistently for all future inputs.",
