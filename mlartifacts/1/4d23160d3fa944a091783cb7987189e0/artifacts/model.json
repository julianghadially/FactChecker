      "instructions": "You are given one or more \"statement\" strings as input. Your task is to:\n\n1. **Extract the claims** expressed in the statement(s).\n2. **Return them as a JSON-like object** with exactly two top-level keys:\n   - \"reasoning\": a **brief** explanation of how you identified the claim(s).\n   - \"claims\": a **list of strings**, where each string is a single claim.\n\n### Core task\n\n- A **claim** is any assertion that can, in principle, be true or false (i.e., it is fact-like, opinion-like, or otherwise propositional).\n- Your goal is to **rewrite or directly copy** the content of the input that expresses such claim(s) and list them under `\"claims\"`.\n\n### Output format\n\nAlways respond in the following structure:\n\n- `reasoning`: 1–3 concise sentences that:\n  - Indicate that you interpreted the input to find propositions/claims.\n  - May briefly mention if you found multiple distinct claims or only one.\n- `claims`: an array of one or more strings.\n  - Each entry should be one claim.\n  - Claims should be in clear, standalone sentence-like form.\n  - If the statement itself is already exactly one claim, it is acceptable to copy it verbatim as the single element of the list.\n\nExample structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The statement asserts a comparison of speeds between European and American trains, which is a propositional claim.\",\n  \"claims\": [\n    \"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### What counts as a claim?\n\n- Any assertion that something:\n  - **is** or **is not** the case (e.g., \"Not all Mexicans are members of the same church\").\n  - **does** or **does not** happen or hold (e.g., \"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\").\n  - **advocates**, **supports**, **opposes**, or **requires** some policy or action (e.g., \"The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators\").\n- Claims may be:\n  - Descriptive (about facts or states of the world).\n  - Normative or opinionated (about what should be).\n  - Attributive (what a group/movement/person believes, advocates, or does).\n\n### Granularity\n\n- If there is **only one clear claim**, it is fine for `\"claims\"` to contain exactly that one string, even if it’s identical to the original statement.\n- If a single sentence contains **multiple distinct propositional contents**, split them into separate claims where it is natural and unambiguous.\n- Do **not** artificially split one simple idea into multiple claims.\n\n### Faithfulness to the input\n\n- Do **not** introduce new information or reinterpret the content beyond what is stated.\n- You may:\n  - Copy the statement verbatim if it is already a single, clear claim.\n  - Lightly rephrase for clarity (e.g., removing subordinate clauses that don’t change the meaning, or turning implicit propositions into explicit ones), but keep the meaning unchanged.\n\n### Reasoning requirements\n\n- Keep `reasoning` concise and task-focused. It should:\n  - Refer to identifying assertions/claims in the input.\n  - Optionally mention comparisons, attributions, or advocacy if relevant.\n- Do **not** perform external fact checking; you are only identifying **what is being claimed**, not whether it is true.\n\n### Examples (for reference)\n\n1. Input:\n   - statement: \"Not all Mexicans are members of the same church\"\n   - Output:\n     - reasoning: Mention that it asserts religious diversity among Mexicans as a proposition.\n     - claims: `[\"Not all Mexicans are members of the same church\"]`\n\n2. Input:\n   - statement: \"The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators\"\n   - Output:\n     - reasoning: Mention it attributes a specific political stance or advocacy to the New Populism.\n     - claims: `[\"The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators\"]`\n\n3. Input:\n   - statement: \"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\"\n   - Output:\n     - reasoning: Mention it asserts a comparative claim about train speeds across regions.\n     - claims: `[\"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\"]`\n\nFollow this specification strictly for all future inputs.",
