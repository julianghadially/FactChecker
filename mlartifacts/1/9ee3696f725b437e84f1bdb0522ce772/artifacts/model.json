      "instructions": "You are given one or more natural-language statements as input. Your task is to extract the *claims* expressed in the text.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n- A **claim** is a declarative statement that asserts something about the world that could, in principle, be checked against evidence (i.e., it is verifiable or falsifiable). In this task, claims are typically factual assertions about entities, events, properties, or relations.\n\n- Do **not** decide whether the claim is true or false. Do not label it as supported, refuted, or unknown. Your only job is to extract the claim(s) in a clear canonical form.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n\nThe input will contain:\n- A field named `statement` (or similar) that holds one or more natural-language sentences.\n\nExample of the format:\n- `statement`: `Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015`\n\nYOUR OUTPUT\n\nYou must produce two fields:\n\n1. `reasoning`  \n   - A short explanation of why the extracted text qualifies as a claim (i.e., that it asserts a verifiable fact or relation).\n   - Do not discuss whether it is supported or refuted, only that it is an assertion that could be checked.\n\n2. `claims`  \n   - A JSON-style list (array) of strings.\n   - Each string should be one extracted claim, rewritten in a clear, self-contained form if needed.\n   - If there is one claim, return a single-element list.\n   - If there are multiple distinct claims, return all of them as separate elements in the list.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING CLAIMS\n\n1. **Verifiability**\n   - Include statements that make factual assertions about entities, events, quantities, comparisons, or relationships.\n   - Example:  \n     - Input: `Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015`  \n       → Claim: `Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015`\n   - Example:  \n     - Input: `Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans`  \n       → Claim: `Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans`\n\n2. **Comparative and relational claims**\n   - Comparative statements like “X is more Y than Z” are claims if they describe a factual relationship that can be checked.\n   - Example:  \n     - `Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans` → one claim.\n\n3. **Implicit or pronominal references**\n   - If a statement refers to entities or events with pronouns or context (e.g., “both victories”), rewrite the claim to be self-contained only if the necessary information is explicitly given in the provided statement.\n   - If necessary context (like which victories) is missing from the given statement, still extract the claim as expressed, but do not add new information.\n   - Example:  \n     - Input: `Both victories were led by Diego Maradona`  \n       → Claim: `Diego Maradona led both victories`\n\n4. **Single vs multiple claims**\n   - If the statement clearly contains only one factual assertion, return a list with that single claim.\n   - If there are multiple distinct factual assertions (e.g., “X happened in 2010 and Y happened in 2015”), extract each as a separate claim string.\n\n5. **What NOT to do**\n   - Do not:\n     - Judge truthfulness or provide labels like SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or UNKNOWN.\n     - Generate evidence, sources, or external information.\n     - Include questions, commands, or pure opinions as claims unless they contain an embedded factual assertion.\n   - Your role is purely **extraction and light rewriting for clarity**, not verification.\n\nSTYLE REQUIREMENTS\n\n- `reasoning` should be concise but explicit about why the extracted text is a claim (e.g., it asserts a specific fact about X that can be checked).\n- `claims` must be a JSON-like list of strings (e.g., `['...']`), with no extra commentary.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n1. Input:\n   - statement: `Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015`\n\n   Output:\n   - reasoning:  \n     The statement asserts a specific fact about Jack Dorsey's role at Twitter and the year it occurred, which can be independently verified.\n   - claims:  \n     ['Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015']\n\n2. Input:\n   - statement: `Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans`\n\n   Output:\n   - reasoning:  \n     The statement asserts a comparative fact about the average weekly working hours of Canadians and Mexicans, which is verifiable.\n   - claims:  \n     ['Canadians work fewer hours per week than Mexicans']\n\n3. Input:\n   - statement: `Both victories were led by Diego Maradona`\n\n   Output:\n   - reasoning:  \n     The statement asserts that Diego Maradona led both of the referenced victories, which is a factual claim about his role in those events and can be checked.\n   - claims:  \n     ['Diego Maradona led both victories']",
