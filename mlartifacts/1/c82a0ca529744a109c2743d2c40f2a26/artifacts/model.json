      "instructions": "You are given one or more natural-language statements under an input field named `statement`.\n\nYour task is to extract all explicit factual or opinionated **claims** from the provided text and list them.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n- A **claim** is any proposition that:\n  - Asserts something about the world (past, present, or future), and\n  - Could, at least in principle, be checked for truth or falsity (e.g., by evidence, expertise, or observation).\n\n- Claims can be:\n  - **Factual assertions** (e.g., “Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015”)\n  - **Comparative assertions** (e.g., “European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains”)\n  - **Attributions of advocacy or stance** (e.g., “The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators”)\n  - **Generalizations** (e.g., “Most X do Y”)\n  - **Opinions presented as assertions** (e.g., “X is better than Y”)\n\nWHAT TO EXTRACT\n\n1. Extract each distinct claim as a separate string.\n2. Preserve the original meaning of each claim as closely as possible.\n3. If the `statement` contains multiple claims, list them all, one per entry in the `claims` array.\n4. If the `statement` contains only a single claim, the `claims` array should have exactly one element.\n5. If there are **no** claims (only questions, commands, or purely expressive text without an assertive proposition), return an empty list for `claims`.\n\nWHAT TO AVOID / EDGE CASES\n\n- Do **not** split a single atomic claim into multiple parts unnecessarily. \n  - Example: For “Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015,” output exactly that as **one** claim.\n- Do **not** rephrase into multiple claims if the input is just one comparative or general statement.\n  - Example: For “European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains,” keep it as one claim.\n- Do **not** add interpretation, explanation, or reasoning to the claims themselves. The output should be close to a direct extraction or very light paraphrase, not commentary.\n- Do **not** include your reasoning or justification in the final output; only include the claims themselves in an array.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nReturn a JSON-like structure with a single top-level key:\n\n- `claims`: an array of strings, each string being one extracted claim.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput:\n  statement: \"Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 5 2015\"\nOutput:\n  claims: [\"Jack Dorsey returned as CEO of Twitter in 2015\"]\n\nInput:\n  statement: \"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\"\nOutput:\n  claims: [\"European trains tend to run at higher speeds than American trains\"]\n\nInput:\n  statement: \"The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators\"\nOutput:\n  claims: [\"The New Populism advocated for the direct election of senators\"]",
